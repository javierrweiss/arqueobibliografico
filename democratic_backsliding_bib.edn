While the concept can play its part, the emergence of a backsliding paradigm risks reproducing, in reverse, the intellectual constraints of the transition paradigm of the 1990s, famously critiqued by Thomas Carothers.

Importantly, the expansive interest in democracy is not merely academic. Instead, studies on democracy are irrefutably empirically driven. Earlier work on the causes and effects of democracy—such as when, why and how do democratic transitions occur, and who are the proponents of transitions—was spurred in no small part by the expansion of liberal democracies in the Second Wave of democratisation following World War II that, set against the backdrop of economic crises and the rise of fascism that preceded the war, saw economic booms and an expanding middle class in the United States and across Europe (Huntington, 1991; Lipset, 1959; Moore, 1966). These themes persisted through scholarship on the Third Wave of democratic transition between 1974 and 1990, with voluminous works on the relationship between democracy and economic development explaining or predicting the spread of democratisation in Southern Europe, Latin America, and East and Southeast Asia, which appeared to coincide with economic growth in the 1970s and 1980s in these regions (Huntington, 1991; O'Donnell et al., 1986; Przeworski, 1991; Remmer, 1991). Notably, events on the ground in the Third Wave also brought new research pursuits, such as the regional and international diffusion of democracy, the effects of democracy on economic growth, and popular support for democracy (Bratton & Mattes, 2001; Brinks & Coppedge, 2006; Helliwell, 1994; Pevehouse, 2002). Unsurprisingly, then, recent trends of democratic stalling, reversals, backsliding and deconsolidation are driving the latest research about the quality and depth of democracy, which may be defined as the extent to which democracy in practice approximates its philosophical foundations of ‘government by the people’ (Fishman, 2016).", :year 2021, :openAccessPdf {:url "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/app5.324", :status "GOLD"}, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "Asia & the Pacific Policy Studies"}, :authors [{:authorId "104453168", :name "O.

Relying on a set-theoretical approach, Weyland concludes that populists succeed in subverting democracy only when institutional weakness and conjunctural misfortune are observed jointly in a polity, thereby conferring on the United States immunity to democratic reversal. We challenge this conclusion on two grounds. First, we argue that the focus on institutional dynamics neglects the impact of the structural conditions in which institutions are embedded, such as inequality, racial cleavages, and changing political attitudes among the public. Second, we claim that endogeneity, coding errors, and the (mis)use of Boolean algebra raise questions about the accuracy of the analysis and its conclusions.

More recently, however, democratic progress has stalled, populism has been on the rise, and a number of democracies around the world are either backsliding or failing entirely. What explains this contemporary crisis of democracy despite conditions theorized to promote democratic success?\n Research on democratization and democracy promotion tends to focus predominantly on elections. Although necessary for democracy, free and fair elections are more effective at promoting democratic progress when they are held in states with strong institutions, such as those that can guarantee the rule of law and constraints on executive power. However, increased globalization and international economic integration have stunted the development of these institutions by limiting states’ economic policy options, and, as a result, their fiscal policy space. When a state’s fiscal policy space—or, its ability to collect and spend revenue—is limited, governments are less able to provide public goods to citizens, politicians rely on populist rather than ideological appeals to win votes, and elections lose their democratizing potential.\n Additional research from a political–economic framework that incorporates insights from studies on state building and institutions with recent approaches to democratization and democracy promotion, which focus predominantly on elections, is needed.

Case study of Albania on its path to Europeanization", :abstract "In this study, the outcome of EU governance and thus Europeanization in Albania – in its path to accession - is to be analysed and its results explained. Albania, a candidate country to join the EU, has been praised for its constructive regional policy and, as a NATO member, is shielded from any security threat. Indeed, Albania has not historically had any inter-ethnic conflict, given the homogeneous population, nor has the country engaged in any direct war with neighbouring countries. Furthermore, its path to accession is not further restricted by unresolved bilateral issues with any countries in the region or an EU Member State. To a certain extent, it provides a clean slate for analysing the results of the double level game between the EU and gatekeeper elites. Thus, the study can be replicated to other candidate countries in the region, following any possible resolution of lingering bilateral conflicts. \nIn Albania, as the EU has declared a halt to enlargement, has Europeanization too, hit the brake? I maintain that the domestic and international politics often entwine, and in the case of enlargement towards Albania I aim to elucidate when and how. The critical juncture and starting point of analysing EU Albania interactions was Albania obtaining EU candidate status in June 2014 when the politically lead European Commission was declaring a halt to enlargement. One main hypothesis is that in the presence of a vague commitment on the part of the EU, reforms will pay mere lip-service to Europeanization. I refer as well to other determinants of choice that inform the strategies of interaction between the EU and Albania. The candidate status sets the start of the analysis EU Albania interactions. \nThe methodological approach I employ in this research is largely qualitative. I envisage a mechanism of intervening variables in a process which yields results of Europeanization in Albania, in order to offer an explanation of what happened and why. My resulting theory develops process tracing predictions and performs a root cause analysis dependent on a causal sequence and links between the contributing factors and the root cause(s). I perform this study by relying on historical and legal analysis as an inherent part of my argument. By explaining the development of EU institutions and EU modes of Europeanization vis-a-vis candidate countries, it is possible to infer causality through this type of analysis. Moreover, I supplement process tracing with other qualitative methods analysing official declarations, public speeches, political statements, and press releases of the main EU, Western Balkans’ and Albanian actors. I complete the analysis with semi-structured interviews with Albanian and EU Member States diplomats, along with insights from EU officials and experts both in Brussels and Tirana. My field research in Tirana has culminated in an original survey on Albanian public opinion, carried out from 5 to 19 November 2016, regarding the issues of concern for Albania and perceptions of the EU in the country. \nThe study reveals only lip service is being paid to the concept of Europeanization. The domestic adaptation is not based on institutional compatibility or understood as ‘command’ and ‘compulsion’ that entail a hierarchical, asymmetric, top-down relation. Instead, the domestic adaptation is understood as a process to support mobilization for domestic reforms that have to be initiated from within, at the domestic level. The logic of Europeanization then becomes that of shaping beliefs at the domestic level. This study has confirmed that Europeanization, before a halt in enlargement, as a process, is dependent on socialization, a direct mode of Europeanization under the logic of appropriateness. These are largely shaped by their interactions where both parties come to have a clear understanding of the direction taken by their relation. \nThe introduced causal mechanism is valid as there is a weaker relative dependence, in the presence of an inward-looking EU marred by internal challenges that has imposed a halt - a wait and see approach - on considering enlargement as a priority. The vague commitment on enlargement serves as an amplifier to strategic calculations on Level II, gatekeeper elites. At the same time, alternative flows of investments and/or money, coupled with the security shield of NATO, commands only a formal adoption of the acquis on the part of gatekeeper elites, but not its implementation. The EU on the other hand, will – within the limits of its toolbox – maintain a lenient policy to maintain gatekeeper elites on the negotiation table. \nIndeed, in Albania, reforms are adopted only nominally to get the country just ahead of the curve in its path to accession. Internally, Albanians struggle within a competitive authoritarianism where the sole concern of gatekeeper elites lies in gaining and keeping privileges by overtly resorting to political patronage. Democratic institutions are not enough to resist such practices. In fact, competitive authoritarianism flourishes in this paradox, where legislative loopholes, enforcement of \npatronage, co-option and corruption are all skilfully managed so as not to inspire a violent domestic dissent or external condemnation. The high leverage points to address Europeanization predicaments in the country remain to better the economic situation through international cooperation so that people are not concerned with making ends meet. Thus, setting the ground for better conditions to support a stronger and larger involvement of citizens in decision making processes. Empowering Civil Society remains a political imperative to answer the appeals of European citizens and to address the concerns of Albanians that yearn for progress in the path of Europeanization. \nThe results of the public opinion survey I conducted in Tirana further underlines the bleak socio-economic and institutional situation in the country. Albanians struggle to make ends meet and harbour a deep mistrust toward their political system, both political parties and government. \nThe exchanges and interactions between the EU and gatekeeper elites have largely resulted with the formal adoption of legislation but no effective implementation or track record. Arenas of contestation are largely corrupted and thus there is limited room for effective push back on competitive authoritarian practices that engulf public life. \nThe EU may be entrenched in its internal dimensions and may have, for now, lost its appetite for enlargement, but the Albanians do still largely regard the EU positively both on political and economic levels and are optimistic about its future. Membership of Albania in the EU is still seen as beneficial for the country. Issues like Brexit or the purported weakening of EU influence in the world seem not to be a concern for Albanians. They are aware of the issues the EU is facing, like the migrant crisis and terrorism; Albanians have an understanding of the economic crisis the EU economy has undergone. The perception’s of Albanians on the challenges the EU is facing does not seem to be at odds with European results at the EU level. \nMore should be done as the linkages of the EU in the region are ever weaker, the threat of democratic backsliding within the Union – with elections in France, Germany and the Netherlands - plus the vagueness of the accession perspective may put into question the EU’s role in championing democracy in the wider region. \nThe EU has a large set of tools that can be used in the region, but they have to be used strategically, coherently and effectively, measuring steps towards the path of accession to be taken not too slowly, nor too fast. Postponing accession sine die, may undermine achievements in these past two decades and threaten stability in the region. The high leverage points – international economic cooperation and empowering civil society are good starting points. \nMoreover, the enlargement process should be renewed and rethought for the EU to be fully accountable to public opinion, but as well, to inspire progress in issues of concern to Albanians, and those concerning the wider Western Balkans’ region. In doing so, clarity of policy steps is necessary for to make any headway. The EU should set short and medium term goals to afford local and national politicians the opportunity to confront their constituency with results. The evaluation of the progress attained should aim for full transparency, moving away from a technical exercise to a politically accountable one. This is attainable by putting in place a diligent credible process which by setting and holding its ground inspires those reforms domestically and, most importantly, inspires their application for the concrete progress of society.", :year 2017, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes ["Review"], :journal {:name "", :volume ""}, :authors [{:authorId "122378638", :name "Enika Bushi"}]} {:paperId "02479c2d6a06b6964d0bb025f4d51b672d741abf", :title "Delegitimization, Deconstruction and Control: Undermining the Administrative State", :abstract "Three phenomena that undermine the U.S. administrative state were taken to extremes under President Trump, contributing to democratic backsliding.

Thus, at minimum the differentiation between inclusionary and exclusionary patterns of democratic political culture would have benefited from a more rigorous theoretical justification.

We argue that Brazil’s stealth intervention, built upon the military’s existing tutelary prerogatives and driven by an unreformed praetorian worldview that resurfaced amidst a sustained crisis of democracy, challenges the prevalent view of the armed forces as a reactive force that intervenes in civilian politics only when its institutional interests are threatened.

In this review, I shall concentrate on Philo and Miller’s extended piece but I also recommend reading the other essays, which range across such topics as corporate culture, privatisation and regulation. Essentially, the book is a manifesto for the renewal of critical social science, prompted in particular by what Philo and Miller regard as the political backsliding of media and cultural studies. It is also a polemic against unrestrained capitalism and the dominance of free market ideology, in a similar mood to Thomas Frank’s critique of ‘market populism’. At a time when inequalities and injustices in the world have worsened, it is paradoxical that the very strands of academic research and education where you would expect to nd responsible criticism have become peculiarly quiescent. The opening essay in the book is not, however, so much a general attack on complacency in the social sciences and humanities as speci cally a critique of mainstream media and cultural studies. In their essay, which was previously circulated as a photostat among interested parties and revised in response to comments, Philo and Miller set up the targets. First and foremost, they challenge the widespread assumption that the central problems of modern politics and society—most particularly, inequality and injustice—have somehow been surpassed by postmodernity. The gap between rich and poor, nationally (in, say, the USA and Britain) and internationally, widened dramatically in the nal quarter of the twentieth century. Yet, this is obscured by the ascendancy of a neoliberalism that venerates market forces as the determinant of everything and the solution to all problems. Socialist and social-democratic politics are said to be passé. The joys of consumption outshine concern with exploitation and democratic participation. And the media are part and parcel of the global capitalist process both economically and in terms of ideological legitimation. What do media and cultural studies have to say about all this? Very little, it would seem. The postmodern myth is largely accepted uncritically. The media are not seen primarily as legitimising agents for capitalism but, instead, as the virtual reality in which we make sense of ourselves and get the best out of life. The media are actually both. It is necessary, I would argue, to analyse this combination dialectically. However, the  eld is split into broadly two camps, respectively addressing the thesis and antithesis of a broken dialectic.

This explanation is underspecified. It does not make clear why people are turning towards authoritarian rule instead of working to strengthen democratic institutions. It cannot explain why we are seeing, specifically, a turn to the politics of discipline in countries like the Philippines. We need a better grasp of how weak institutions are experienced and how this experience shapes people's attitudes towards democracy. Drawing upon several years of ethnographic research, I depict the experience of democracy of the upper and middle class in Metro Manila. For informants, the problem of democracy is not that institutions are weak but that valued institutions are actively contradicted by disvalued ones. They describe an experience of disorder, identifying four major sources: corruption, rule-bending, clientelism, and informal settlement. A view of democracy as disorder prompts calls for \"disciplining\" it. These findings lead us to reframe the issue. Whereas a weak institutions' framework emphasizes the gap between valued rules and regressive norms, I emphasize their contradiction as shaping perceptions of disorder. Contradiction is experienced as a moral dilemma, a conflict between how things are done and how they should be done.

Coming at the end of the Cold War, with its mood of high optimism, the article fit the era perfectly. Bundling a provocative claim with a positive prediction about the future trajectory of the law, the piece was read widely in its time and thereafter, prompting at least two previous rounds of retrospection, and thousands of citations.2 The world has changed a bit since the early 1990s. The “Third Wave” of democracy, so celebrated at the time, peaked in roughly 2006.3 Since that year, political scientists who track democracy have noted that the number of democracies has declined. Furthermore, within countries, the quality of democracy has slipped, with democratic “declines” outnumbering “advances” in each year.4 Indeed, according to a 2017 Economist Intelligence Unit report, more countries in the world are categorized as autocracies or “hybrid regimes” than are categorized as having some form of democracy.5 The “Third Wave,” it seems, is receding.6 Our era of democratic backsliding invites a retrospective assessment of the “right” to democratic governance. Did Franck’s “emerging” right ever actually crystalize? If so, what precisely is its scope? How has it been enforced?

The analysis is structured in three parts. The first part introduces three country cases – Bulgaria (mainstreaming of populist securitisation); Macedonia (ethnic securitisation in a deeply-divided society); and Serbia (democratic backsliding and populist authoritarianism). The three case studies reveal an important variation in the dynamics and outcomes of a broader populist and authoritarian trend that swept across the region. The three countries illustrate various types of civic resistance and contestatory citizenship. The two other parts are comparative: They enlarge the countries’ coverage and identify major regional trends from two perspectives: populist and authoritarian misuses of security threats and authoritarian trends; and emergence and diversification of forms of citizenship as expression of civic resilience. Nationalist, populist and authoritarian politics have moved from the periphery of the political scene to the mainstream. The trend takes a paradoxical form: on the one hand, a promotion of the EU agenda and regional co-operation; on the other hand, securitisation, construction of political opponents, ethnic, religious and cultural Others, and civic activists as threats to national security and national identity. The civic resistance and human rights responses to populist authoritarianism and mainstreamed securitisation are analysed through the theoretical lenses of citizenship.

First, it reviews the various conditionality mechanisms the EU deployed throughout the accession process to ensure the transposition of EU rules.

This paper then employs a discursive institutionalist perspective, which focuses on norms and discourses as the key factors protecting democratic procedures and institutions. In doing so, it explains how the absence of democratic deliberation can have significant consequences for the institutionalization of liberal democratic values in newly consolidated democracies.

In contrast, with more recent data, Kremer, Willis, and You (2021) find evidence that since the mid-1980s there has been a trend towards unconditional convergence culminating in absolute convergence since 2000. Additionally, they find suggestive evidence that one of the major drivers of this trend is an underlying convergence towards development-favored policies. We discuss the implications of this result through the lens of individual welfare and poverty, concluding that the news is not as welcome as it may seem for the world’s poor. We point out that absolute convergence has happened contemporaneously with rising within-country inequality, resulting in more of the world’s poor living in middle-income countries. Next, we argue that domestic redistribution is essential to spread the benefits from industrialization, since the labor share of manufacturing isn’t reaching the heights it did in industrialized countries. Finally, we argue that the democratic institutions that can facilitate this redistribution themselves face headwinds.

In another interesting finding, Chapter 4 argues that the people rarely trust anyone other than family and relatives, in a context that is detrimental visa-vis institutional trust in heterogeneous states such as Bosnia & Hercegovina and Macedonia, where, as Chapter 5 notes, support for democracy is the lowest in the region. The sixth chapter, focusing on the prosecution of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed during the Yugoslav wars, highlights that these trials had a ‘beneficial impact’ or ‘collateral profit’ on democratisation by removing from the scene problematic personalities whose continued presence represented an obstacle to the region’s democratic development. To illustrate how democratisation patterns were influenced by the specific political and socio-economic landscapes, the volume presents separate country studies (Chapters 7–14) on each of the Yugoslav successor states, including Vojvodina. The volume’s concluding remarks are introduced in its fifteenth chapter, which ties together the key findings while offering some perspectives for the future. Slovenia, with some backsliding, comes very close to achieving liberal democracy standards; the biggest democratic achievements have occurred in Croatia, Kosovo and Serbia, with the least progress in Bosnia & Hercegovina, Macedonia and Montenegro. Challenging expectations equating democratisation as a direct transition to clear-cut liberal democracy, the experience of the post-Yugoslav states indicates that democracy building remained a secondary priority across the region. These features defined the continuous tendency of ‘political actors to leverage fear’ over their populations (p. 399). Bosnia & Hercegovina falls seriously short of being able to meet the needs of its citizens; Kosovo’s capacities are not yet built up; Croatia is incapable of reform; Macedonia has been unsuccessful even by Balkan standards; Montenegro is yet to test succession in its political leadership; Slovenia still needs further transformation; and Serbia has repackaged itself under the lingering cult of particular personalities. This volume, which is an excellent resource on the post-Yugoslav states, examines democratisation from new angles and assesses the democratisation attempts implemented in the region. While acknowledging the book’s analytical breadth, this reviewer would have been interested in some more comparative work, specifically on whether and how the particular patterns of democratisation seen in the Yugoslav successor states relate to democratisation efforts in other parts of the world. Another weakness is that the volume takes for granted that democracy was the path chosen, providing very limited analysis on the motivations behind his choice.

This contribution takes a slightly different approach. The so-called ‘democratic breakdown’ or ‘backsliding’ in rights and the rule of law should not be regarded as a (mere) attribute of the post-coup aftermath. The idea that a process of democratization in Turkey derailed or became disrupted after the coup only feeds the myth that there had been such a process of pre-coup democratization. In this article, it is argued that the reforms often held up as a ‘democratization’ were rather instruments opportunistically employed in the Adalet ve Kalkınma Partisi (Justice and Development Party, AKP) struggle to conquer the state, to take it from a Kemalist elite and to roll back and contain a Kurdish movement that made pleas for a pluralistic citizenship and the strengthening of civil rights. These have now morphed into an overt authoritarianism, in which a regime of exceptions, not unknown to the Kurds and the Kurdistan region in Turkey, has become the norm, the particular generalized.

Although group members frequently reject criticism from individuals outside their own group relative to criticism from within the group (intergroup sensitivity effect), it remains unclear whether this effect holds for calls for unity across party lines. Additionally, the democratic process may itself help to mend intergroup sensitivity. Our high-powered experiment with self-identified U.S. Democratic or Republican voters across three time points during the 2020 U.S. presidential election demonstrates consistent rejection of calls for unity across party lines, which differentially affected consequent reconciliatory behavior. While the ascription of unconstructive motives decreased reconciliatory behavior, heightened threat perceptions increased reconciliatory behavior. Effects were consistent across time and party affiliation, indicating that the democratic election process and the determination of the election outcome were unable to mend intergroup sensitivity across the partisan divide. Calls for unity affected the reported emotional experience of pride but these self-reports had no consistent impact on behavior.

Populists sometimes seek protection in the military, who in turn leverage the relationship to advance their own interests. Despite the recent wave of populism, the burgeoning literature on it has not devoted due attention to analysing the populist-military relationship; its origins, outcomes, and tensions. This article analyses the Brazilian military’s re-appearance under President Jair Bolsonaro. Absent the usual institutional support bases on which Brazilian presidents rely, Bolsonaro has cultivated military support with resources and positions that allow officers expanded political power and privilege. An equilibrium held for the government’s first two years. Thereafter, growing reservations about propping up an increasingly unpopular president, especially by heeding orders that would threaten their professional integrity, put in question the future of the armed forces as a pillar of the Bolsonaro administration. At the same time, the military’s substantial expansion in government and state positions under Bolsonaro raises the specter of elevated military autonomy under future administrations. This would be problematic for popular sovereignty, a cornerstone of democracy, even if uniformed officers are not saber-rattling, mounting coups or occupying presidential office.", :year 2021, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "Democratization", :pages "337 - 359", :volume "29"}, :authors [{:authorId "2106301140", :name "Wendy Hunter"} {:authorId "146561055", :name "Diego Vega"}]} {:paperId "0d48c688cfcf8e357b051a238c042d1c9b09ea89", :title "International and Domestic Dimensions of Russia’s G8 Presidency in 2006", :abstract "Abstract In 2006, as president of the Group of Eight (G8), Russia intended to increase its global status, respond to foreign criticism about its democratic credentials, and advance key policy positions. In determining whether these goals were met, the author examines six important issues that Russia’s G8 presidency covered, including its agenda items (global energy security, infectious diseases, and education), nuclear nonproliferation, counter-terrorism, and the crisis in the Middle East. Informed by international socialization theory, the author finds that the G8 presidency gave Russia a high-profile platform on which to assert its national interests and sovereignty. President Vladimir Putin showcased Russia’s strengths in various ways, ranging from symbolic images of its renewed grandeur to demonstrations of its independent policy line on energy security and rhetoric about its democratizing the G8 decision-making process. He also benefited from the fact that other G8 leaders did not publicly press him on issues related to Russia’s authoritarian backsliding. However, Russia’s achievements as G8 president were soon overshadowed by worsening relations with the United States and the European Union; by further restrictions on civil society; and by high-profile assassinations. The behaviour of Russian officials during 2006 indicates that international socialization was not taking place in any meaningful way beyond a display of diplomatic code (e.g., rhetoric on consensus-building).", :year 2008, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "Canadian Slavonic Papers", :pages "397 - 423", :volume "50"}, :authors [{:authorId "113644969", :name "P.

El objetivo principal de este ensayo es analizar algunos problemas particularmente duraderos de la democracia mexicana. Para ser concretos, argumento que la compra de votos en buena parte con recursos ilegales de campaña, sigue siendo frecuente el día de hoy. Mediante una revisión de la literatura académica más reciente, así como de fuentes de investigación periodística, el artículo busca esclarecer estos problemas así como sus posibles soluciones. La literatura revisada en este ensayo sugiere que la incidencia del clientelismo electoral sigue siendo alta, lo cual pone al país en riesgo de retroceso democrático de manera similar a otras regiones del mundo como Europa del Este y Sudamérica. Para sustentar estas aseveraciones, repaso varias acusaciones que se han hecho a los partidos principales en México por parte de sus rivales políticos y de observadores académicos. Las acusaciones de financiamiento ilegal de campaña que se han hecho incluyen el Monexgate del PRI, los moches del PAN y el charolazo del PRD. Las acusaciones de compra de apoyo político incluyen el abuso del programa Oportunidades así como del presupuesto de las delegaciones en la Ciudad de México. Asimismo, describo algunos esfuerzos notables para reglamentar estas conductas en la reforma político electoral de 2014, tales como la fiscalización en tiempo real y la prohibición del turismo electoral.

The main goal of this essay is to analyze some particularly lasting problems of the Mexican democracy. I argue that vote buying, largely with illegal campaign resources, continues to be frequent. By reviewing the recent academic literature, as well as primary bibliographic references, the essay seeks to shed light on these problems along with possible solutions. I claim that the prevalence of electoral clientelism puts the country at risk of “democratic backsliding” of the kind that has been observed in other regions of the world such as Eastern Europe and South America. To substantiate these claims, I review several accusations that have been made against the main political parties in Mexico by their rivals and academic observers. The accusations of illegal campaign financing that have been made include the Monexgate by the PRI, the moches by the PAN, and the charolazo by the PRD. The accusations of buying political support include the abuse of the anti-poverty program Oportunidades as well as the budgets of the Delegaciones in Mexico City. Furthermore, I describe some of the notable efforts to regulate this behavior in the 2014 electoral reform, such as auditing the parties’ finances in “real time” and the prohibition of “electoral tourism.” After arguing that legislative efforts have been insufficient. I conclude that further progress in democratic consolidation requires a wider inclusion of civic organizations and common citizens in the political system.", :year 2017, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes ["JournalArticle" "Review"], :journal {:name "Revista Mexicana de Estudios Electorales"}, :authors [{:authorId "145001087", :name "Gilles Serra"}]} {:paperId "0db621d320726b6652492b1ce527885112fc56cc", :title "Democratic Backsliding and the Unravelling of the EU Legal Order", :abstract "The political world of the EU has often been accused of being a Potemkin village. It had a flag, a parliament and elections, but behind this façade the voters were not really engaged.1 This has fueled a tendency to easily perceive existential crises for the Union. With no real European demos, EU political institutions were seen as hollow and commentators found it easy to predict that they would be swept away when faced with a serious political problem. However, the Union’s legal situation was the opposite. Here a fairly modest institutional impression, namely a single international court sitting in Luxembourg, belied a deeply integrated, almost federal, legal order in which national courts across the Union applied EU law and rulings of the Court of Justice day in day out in the cases that came before them. Academics studying European integration noted the particular prominence of the role of law in the building of the EU, going so far as to describe the process as one of ‘integration through law’ in a seminal study from the late 1980s.2 And they had a point. Enforcement is usually the Achilles heel of international law. Often only states can make complaints of breaches of international obligations and adjudication of such complaints takes place in front of international tribunals whose rulings are difficult to enforce. But EU law was different. The European Court ruled in the 1960s that EU law could be invoked by individuals in front of their national courts and that national judges had a duty to give effect to EU in their rulings (this is known as ‘direct effect’) and to set aside any national law that clashed with EU law (this is known as primacy).3 National judges, for a number of reasons, went along with this and thereby transformed the nature of the European integration project.4 The acceptance of primacy and direct effect had a huge impact on the importance of EU law. Rather than being, as much international law is, a difficult to enforce declaration on paper, EU law was fully binding.

Despite the gains experienced in the early 1990s when Africa experienced a beehive of democratic activities occasioned by both internal and external pressures, resulting in former dictators becoming born again democrats, the continent seems to be going through a new wave of democratic backsliding. Even though military coups have subsided (not completely eliminated), the bane of democratic governance in Africa is the menace of elected rulers undermining their own constitutions to prolong their stay in power. In Nigeria, Niger, Zimbabwe, Burkina Faso, Madagascar, Burundi and a host of other African countries, elected leaders have attempted to reverse democratic gains by manipulating their constitutions to stay longer in power. This paper focuses on the fast prevailing attempts by African leaders, most of whom are previous military dictators and guerrilla fighters to extend their stay in power by abrogating the term limit in the constitutions of their country. They achieve this through the twin instruments of cooptation and intimidation. This development has created new anxieties about the survival of democracy in Africa. ‘Third termism’, sit tight syndrome and ‘democratic authoritarianism’ have (re) surfaced in the political lexicon of Africa.

Positions of the European Parliament ’ s Political Groups towards Sanctions against Democratic Backsliding", :abstract "Although the European Union (EU) has never used sanctions internally against member state governments that breach liberal democratic principles, preferences inside EU institutions about the use of such sanctions diverge. As the salience of ‘democratic backsliding’ inside the EU has increased during this decade, anecdotal evidence suggests that party politics play a key role in determining attitudes towards sanctions: parties strategically oppose sanctions to protect target governments that belong to their own European party family. This paper conducts a first systematic analysis of this claim. I examine a most likely case for partisan politics – the positions of political groups in the European Parliament (EP). A fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis of attitudes towards the use of sanctions to address backsliding in Hungary (since 2010), Romania (in 2012), and Poland (since 2015) finds that party politics indeed matter. However, they cannot be reduced to the ideological distance (in Left/Right terms) between an EP party group and a target government. Preferences about sanctions are the result of conjectural causation, in which parties’ commitment to liberal democracy as well as their attitudes towards European integration also play a role. One implication of this finding is that while partisan politics can be an obstacle to the internal use of sanctions by EU institutions, specific partisan configurations in target countries are more conducive to the imposition of sanctions, e.g. if the target governments is composed of a party of the Left. Introduction Among the various activities of the European Union (EU) to promote democracy, one area has so far received very little scholarly attention: sanctions in response to a deterioration of democracy in the EU’s member states. One reason for this neglect is that although the Treaty of Amsterdam introduced the possibility to sanction member states that commit serious and persistent breaches of liberal democratic principles, these sanctions have never been used. At the same time, over this decade we have witnessed a dramatic increase in the salience of the debate to use sanctions in the face of instances of ‘democratic backsliding’ – reversals of democratic reforms – and serious deteriorations of liberal democratic practices in EU member states. 1 This paper has benefitted from funding through the FP7 project MAXCAP “Maximizing the integration capacity of the European Union: Lessons of and prospects for enlargement and beyond” (2013-16).

Populists promote political polarization to build sustainable ruling coalitions during and between elections that legitimize and support the illiberal policies above.

Across cases, the crisis is multi-layered, involving first, counter-revolution since the 2011 (and 2019) uprisings and revolutions; second, the breakup of states, particularly those mired in violence (e.g. Libya); and third, setbacks even among states that have to an extent transcended the democratic threshold (e.g. Tunisia). We lay the groundwork for localized and contextualized exploration of ‘degenerations of democratizations' playing out in the region. This involves rethinking the teleological ambit of transitology studies as well as the ‘reverse transitology' scholarship on democratic backsliding. We propose an alternative ‘critical democratization' frame that emphasizes emancipation and attends to the demos. This people-centered approach is fitting for exploring democratization and its setbacks in the context of popular uprisings and revolution. It allows for investigations of local democratic learning and un-learning; local-global and local-regional interactions; entrenched socioeconomic and military structures and disparities; and popular forces of resistance (al-hirak) challenging democratic setbacks.

And who makes the rules – platforms themselves? National governments? International institutions? When it comes to establishing policies to protect people on and off-line, many open questions remain. Governments have largely outsourced content moderation, platform policing, and digital policy to the private sector, often leaving the bulk of the work to the platforms themselves. Against this backdrop, governments have traditionally used two main tools to shape policy: threats of regulation and voluntary compliance programs. However, increasingly frustrated with the ineffectiveness of voluntary commitments, governments are taking a larger role in both defining hate and violent speech online, and clarifying the role that platforms must play. In 2017, after a series of right-wing extremist attacks linked to online hate speech, Germany passed the “Network Enforcement Act” (NetzDG), with the aim of improving the enforcement of law in social networks. NetzDG requires social media platforms with more than two million users to establish user-friendly complaint-reporting mechanisms, remove manifestly unlawful conduct within 24 hours, and deliver transparency reports twice a year. Importantly, NetzDG forces platforms to proactively report hate speech to law enforcement without a court order under penalty of fine. It is the first example of a European state using an aggressive approach to social media regulation, by making content moderation laws compulsory, rather than voluntary. This paper examines NetzDG's global proliferation. It argues that NetzDG’s reproduction in various hybrid and authoritarian regimes is doubly problematic––it is both an indication of authoritarian creep into democratic regimes and an instance of authoritarian learning from democratic regimes. Part One describes NetzDG’s history and specificities. Part Two provides background on the challenges of content moderation. It discusses the big questions that inform the debate about NetzDG specifically and digital regulation more broadly. Part Three explores the global repercussions. First, it describes NetzDG as an example of democratic backsliding in Germany. It then uses the case studies of Russia, Singapore, and Turkey to demonstrate how authoritarian and hybrid regimes justify illiberal actions by invoking the practices of liberal democracies.

Using a simple model, it is shown that incumbents in a dominant position may sacrifice short-term vote maximisation for long-term strategic advantages stemming from the stabilisation of their own supporting base. Weak democratic institutions may also allow them to bend the rules, leading ultimately to a new system: semi-democracy.

Additionally, I will look at the impact that institutions and institutional legacy, overall level of democracy, wealth, and extent of democracy in the region might have upon the restriction of rights and liberties.

Political trust is an essential element as well as an indicator of the legitimacy of the political system. Low trust may lead to political cynicism, a decline of political participation, or, conversely, to the rise of anti-establishment populism. Empirical research shows that political trust is lower in ECE than in older Western European democracies. Equally important is that its volatility is higher and its distribution among the population is more polarized. In this essay, we seek to shed light on some potential reasons for this volatility by arguing that institutional trust in ECE is heavily exposed to politicization. We demonstrate this by relying on data from the European Social Survey. Our models reveal that, all else being equal, voting for the incumbent governing parties has a stronger positive association with institutional trust in Eastern than in Western Europe. We interpret our results according to Easton’s concept of diffuse and specific support.

The government of President Joko Widodo initially ignored the threat, and when it did react, the crisis policies were piecemeal and confusing. But what explains this outcome? It would be easy to attribute Indonesia’s response to its lower middle-income status or its democratic governance structures that lack strong repressive capacity. With countries poorer and more democratic than Indonesia performing better, however, this explanation is unsatisfactory. Going beyond simple development and regime categories, this article proposes that Indonesia’s COVID-19 response was the result of its specific process of democratic decline in the last decade. This backsliding produced intensifying populist anti-scientism, religious conservatism, religio-political polarisation, corruption and clientelism, as well as assertiveness among anti-democratic actors.

More than thirty years after the fall of communism, the assessment of women’s role in democratic politics is timely and important. On the one hand, there has been growing awareness concerning women’s political representation and the need for gender equality in the context of systemic transformation, internationalisation, and Europeanisation (Bego 2015; Chiva 2017; Matland and Montgomery 2003). On the other hand, illiberalism, populism and democratic backsliding have taken hold of the region (Cianetti et al. 2018; Fagan et al. 2020; Norris and Inglehart 2019; Rupnik 2017; Vachudova 2020; Waldner and Lust 2018). However, their effect on gender equality in politics remains largely unexplored. Hence, there is a real need to update the scholarly literature with a comprehensive analysis of post-communist politics in relation to women’s political representation (Gwiazda 2019). Reviewing the changes in female representation in Central and Eastern Europe, a region which has undergone significant political, economic, and social changes in the last few decades, is crucial.

Firstly, what kind of (legal) sources and documents should the court involve in in its legal interpretation? Secondly, what are the trade-offs between offering effective remedy sanctions and respecting the differences between branches of law and the division of power? For purpose of this analysis, we turn to the example of school segregation lawsuits between 2007 and 2022. In terms of equal and equitable education, the regulatory frameworks in the CEE Countries are harmonized to the EU standards and are strongly based on the anti-discrimination approach. In theory, policy programs and documents could be used as a source of facts, as well as a source of information regarding legislative goals and policy context. In theory, courts should aim to opt for sanctions with the most potential to achieve effective remedy. If this leads to specific policy-type sanctions, within the bounds of the parties’ actions courts should be able to decide so. However, courts tend to refrain from such sources and decisions. In the context of democratic backsliding the possibilities of such activism are somewhat unclear. Issues around the independence of the judiciary, the attitude of the executive branch towards certain social policy issues, and the practice of overwriting by amendment on part of the National Assembly supermajority may discourage courts and judges from policy-sensitive or innovative adjudication of cases with social policy relevance.", :year 2023, :openAccessPdf {:url "https://sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/cejpp-2023-0013", :status "GOLD"}, :publicationTypes ["JournalArticle"], :journal {:name "Central European Journal of Public Policy", :pages "1 - 12", :volume "17"}, :authors [{:authorId "2003434324", :name "Borbála Dombrovszky"} {:authorId "94517855", :name "I.

Based on a survey of more than 400 Polish, Hungarian, Czech, and Slovenian interest organizations, we explore, in the context of backsliding, the conditions under which organized interests shift their lobbying activities to alternative, i.e., EU or regional levels. Our statistical analyses indicate that it is rather exclusive policy‐making in general than a lack of individual group access to domestic policy networks that motivate organizations to engage in multilevel lobbying. However, it appears that organizational self‐empowerment and inter‐group cooperation are the “name of the game.” Even under the adverse conditions of democratic backsliding, organizations that are accumulating expertise, professionalizing their operations, and cooperating with other organizations not only can sustain access to (illiberal) national governments but also branch out their operations to the European and regional levels.", :year 2022, :openAccessPdf {:url "https://www.cogitatiopress.com/politicsandgovernance/article/download/5882/5882", :status "GOLD"}, :publicationTypes ["Review"], :journal {:name "Politics and Governance"}, :authors [{:authorId "120290377", :name "R.

We show that this is particularly likely in contexts of high ideological polarization and strong institutional foundations of democracy. This inversion of the power dynamic between parties and politicians provides room for charismatic leaders to enact anti-democratic policies. The likelihood of party illiberalization, democratic backsliding, and autocratic reversion are thus higher under charismatic leaders.

The study suggests that development has to occur outside of the state umbrella to reinforce democracy in autocratic settings. Thus, the expansion of the private sector, which contributes directly to the creation of a middle class whose members do not owe their livelihoods and status to the state, may be viewed as an effective strategy in fostering democracy. Proponents of privatisation as a remedy for scant public support for democracy should not be overly optimistic, however. As Rosenfeld’s study indicates, privatisation will not give rise to greater demand for democracy when accompanied by the impoverishment of the middle class or the absence of upward mobility for the working class. The argument that the state may strategically invest in the formation of a middle class to elicit loyalty and stifle dissent through the management of citizens’ economic self-interests makes it timely reading for all those concerned with the fate of democracy in countries that have recently seen a growth in state involvement in the economy, accompanied by democratic backsliding.

What helps us to understand whether we have reached an inflection point--and whether even long-established European and American democracies are in danger of backsliding? This essay draws on Juan Linz and Alfred Stepan's Problems of Democratic Transition and Consolidation which theorizes that consolidation occurs when three conditions are met: Culturally, the overwhelming majority of people believe that democracy is the best form of government, so that any further reforms reflect these values and principles. Constitutionally, all the major actors and organs of the state reflect democratic norms and practices. Behaviorally, no significant groups actively seek to overthrow the regime or secede from the state. Evidence throws new light on the contemporary state of each of Linz and Stepan's conditions in Western democracies. Culturally the data suggests that, when compared with their parents and grandparents, Millennials in Anglo-American democracies express weaker support for democratic values, but this is not a consistent pattern across Western democracies and post-industrial societies. It is also a life-cycle rather than a generational effect. Constitutionally, trends from estimates by Freedom House and related indicators provide no evidence that the quality of institutions protecting political rights and civil liberties deteriorated across Western democracies from 1972 to end-2016. Most losses occurred under hybrid regimes. Behaviorally, the most serious contemporary threats to Western liberal democracies arise from twin forces that each, in different ways, seek to undermine the regime: sporadic and random terrorist attacks on domestic soil, which damage feelings of security, and the rise of populist-authoritarian forces, which feed parasitically upon these fears.", :year 2017, :openAccessPdf {:url "https://research.hks.harvard.edu/publications/getFile.aspx?Id=1514", :status "GREEN"}, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "Political Economy: National"}, :authors [{:authorId "145639179", :name "P.

It has stimulated the cosmopolitan project of global constitutionalism, transnational integration and the unification of democratic standards. However, it also resulted in the fragmentation of international affairs, the deterioration of constitutional democracy and a feeling of a growing shortage in democracy on national and international levels of governance. Trying to balance the impact of these two opposing trends, the author analyses the positive and negative effects of globalisation on constitutional development regarding such issues as transnational constitutionalisation, democracy and national sovereignty, the changing place of multilayer constitutionalism, the international separation of powers, and the system of global governance in the establishment of transnational constitutional democratic legitimacy. From this point of view, the populist backslide in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) looks dangerous and unforeseen, but it is a systemic and potentially predictable reaction of global regions on the uneven character of integration, the lack of democratic legitimacy and a new answer to the contortions and dysfunctions of global governance. An adequate response to these challenges could be found in a new concept of constitutional integration based on ongoing dialogue between the transnational and national actors of legal globalisation. This dialogue is possible by using a conflict-mediation strategy, elaborated by international experts, especially, for the deliberation of complex and protracted conflicts, which have no clear practical solutions in the short to medium term.", :year 2021, :openAccessPdf {:url "https://journals.umcs.pl/sil/article/download/12750/pdf", :status "GREEN"}, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "Law & Society: Public Law - Constitutional Law eJournal"}, :authors [{:authorId "114832222", :name "Andrey Medushevskiy"}]} {:paperId "169a3c287686905c5e0403d233b2d166c847e3c4", :title "Demokratische Legitimität und Democratic Backsliding", :abstract nil, :year 2020, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes ["Review"], :journal {:name "", :pages "365-386", :volume ""}, :authors [{:authorId "2079487198", :name "Alexander Schmotz"}]} {:paperId "16a2263d21d90cce4403698a066c9fa33bba54d1", :title "The Danger is Real", :abstract "Abstract:Scholars who are willing to argue against doom-mongering on the basis of serious evidence and a subtle counternarrative can make a big contribution to political science and the larger public discourse.

This paper uses cross-national survey data from 74 countries and two methods—a standard cross-sectional analysis and a within-country variation design—to show that a citizen’s conceptualization of democracy, or what democracy means to them, is subject to partisan-motivated reasoning. In other words, citizens are more likely to conceptualize democracy in illiberal terms, like emphasizing the need for obeying authority, when their preferred political party is in power.

Turkey’s regime transition reflects the broader pattern of “executive aggrandizement,” whereby the accountability of elected governments is progressively eroded. Turkey’s regime has slid gradually from an illiberal democracy constrained by the power of the military to an authoritarian regime in which the president monopolizes political power. The political, economic, and institutional contexts in which elections take place are heavily skewed in favor of the incumbents, and the ballot box serves to legitimize the government rather than holding it accountable. The chapter surveys the primary factors that have influenced the process of regime change. In particular, it focuses on the role of persistent electoral victories early in the AKP’s tenure in government, the marginalization of Erdoğan’s rivals within the AKP, the creation of a pro-government business class that controls the media landscape, the role of social welfare practices, and the party’s capture of judicial and security bureaucracies. While Islamic social movements like the Gülen community, as well as the AKP’s Islamist identity, played a role in regime change, religion’s impact on authoritarian transition was minimal.

Erosion takes two forms. (1) In a high sectoral gap, ‘losing’ elites capture the state through a political opportunist, an outsider, who favors them economically. Once in office, the opportunist expands his executive power and attacks democratic institutions. (2) In a high factoral gap, a united economic elite coordinate to stop a populist candidate from taking power and upending the system.

Tunisia’s post-revolutionary democracy had thus succumbed to a populist president within two years from his electoral victory in the context of widespread popular disillusionment with the entire political class. This article draws on the work of Peter Mair, in particular his analysis in Ruling the Void (2013), to understand democratic breakdown in Tunisia. I argue that political dynamics in Tunisia diverge significantly from the standard model of democratic backsliding. Instead, I conceptualize the Tunisian case as breakdown by disengagement. The relative success of Tunisian democratization after the 2014 elite compromise paradoxically fuelled a crisis of representation: The main political camps lost popular support, populist challengers were strengthened, and citizens disengaged from conventional politics in ever greater numbers. Popular disengagement and elite withdrawal into a sphere of competition protected by the elite pact gave rise to a void at the heart of Tunisian democracy. While Kais Saied’s anti-party project proposed to fill this void with an alternative political system built from the bottom up, there is growing evidence of authoritarian retrenchment instead of democratic renewal.", :year 2023, :openAccessPdf {:url "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/2474736X.2023.2279778?needAccess=true", :status "GOLD"}, :publicationTypes ["JournalArticle"], :journal {:name "Political Research Exchange", :volume "5"}, :authors [{:authorId "2266355002", :name "Kevin Koehler"}]} {:paperId "185ffe0f38cf9095528d79e33b591d6025fe0597", :title "Opposition Political Party Approaches and International Assistance Against Democratic Backsliding", :abstract nil, :year 2019, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "", :volume ""}, :authors [{:authorId "51420060", :name "E.

Unfortunately, the evidence seems too mixed to say, at least for this reader. A second important, and rather surprising, finding is that there is little connection between the strength of a mayor’s political position—such as long-term incumbency or co-partisanship with the national party—and her decision to employ clientelist strategies. This finding will certainly interest scholars of democratic backsliding. Finally, scholars of clientelism in other regions like Africa and Latin America will surely pay close attention to the chapter on vote buying; although this is the most-studied aspect of clientelism in the comparative literature,Mares and Young find no evidence that it is effective. One persistent question is whether the powerful can monitor how their clients actually vote. The authors are certainly aware of it, and their ethnographic research mentions a variety of methods, some of them very colorful, that power holders use to address monitoring. For example, several interviewees describe how local kingpins require clients to swear on the Bible that they will vote as instructed (p. 127); one loan shark reports that having a client swear on the Bible while holding her baby gets even better results (p. 160). Should we interpret such vignettes as showing the resourcefulness of the powerful in monitoring compliance, or do they indicate the futility of monitoring compliance in the first place? In terms of the “informational” aspect of clientelism, compliance is unimportant; however, because it is unclear whether the information revealed about a politician’s program by, say, policy favors can overcome the hit to his reputation, the overall calculus underlying the choice to use it remains elusive. Perhaps this choice is not so calculated after all but is motivated just by anti-Roma prejudice? This is not meant as a critique: social-science methods can take us only so far into such a complex decision as voting, and Mares and Young’s book takes us far deeper and more surefootedly than most.

The second is that there is a sharp conceptual distinction between coercive intervention, on the one hand, and mere conversation and speech on the other.

Using Thailand and Myanmar as its case studies, the article discusses the origins, ideology, and impact of several uncivil society groups, deepening our knowledge on the latter's role in democratic backsliding/breakdown. It argues that uncivil society can act as useful resource for conservative elites seeking to derail democratisation processes. Particularly in times of a perceived or manufactured national crisis, uncivil society successfully pursues illiberal agendas – often in tandem with established elites of the former regime. Also highlighted are the core mechanisms through which uncivil society leads to democratic backsliding/breakdown, as well as the long-term effects these movements have on the erosion of social trust and civility and the poisoning of inter-class or inter-religious relations.", :year 2023, :openAccessPdf {:url "https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/18681034231208467", :status "GOLD"}, :publicationTypes ["JournalArticle"], :journal {:name "Journal of Current Southeast Asian Affairs", :pages "372 - 394", :volume "42"}, :authors [{:authorId "100903842", :name "Marco Bünte"}]} {:paperId "1bb3af877d3499fe3f94311caee10b14bb499bf2", :title "Interest Group Strategic Responses to Democratic Backsliding", :abstract "In this article, we offer insights into the plurality of interest groups’ strategic responses to the socially, politically, and economically transformative phenomenon of democratic backsliding. For the purpose of the article, the term “ideational plurality” has been coined to refer to a plurality of interest groups’ ideas leading their activities in general and their choice of strategies concerning the government in particular (attitudinal and behavioural aspects). Two policy fields and two types of interest groups engaged in an institutionalised social partnership—advocacy NGOs (operating in the environmental policy field) and economic groups (trade unions)—are studied comparatively in Slovenia using a mixed‐methods approach. The key findings are that strategic responses to democratic backsliding vary between environmental NGOs and trade unions, as do their ideational plurality, and that environmental NGOs’ ideational plurality damages their potential to struggle against democratic backsliding. In contrast, trade unions’ ideational homogeneity enables them to jointly struggle against governmental destruction of one significant segment of democratic order (institutions of social partnership) without demanding that the government step down for misusing the Covid‐19 pandemic to establish a system of governance that resonates with Viktor Orbán’s ideas of illiberal democracy.", :year 2022, :openAccessPdf {:url "https://www.cogitatiopress.com/politicsandgovernance/article/download/5863/5863", :status "GOLD"}, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "Politics and Governance"}, :authors [{:authorId "1403033131", :name "Danica Fink-Hafner"} {:authorId "143633562", :name "Sara Bauman"}]} {:paperId "1bfb5135e8914b99e742a556790331766217eaa2", :title "Shifts in Support for Authoritarianism and Democracy in the Western Balkans", :abstract "ABSTRACT The countries of the Western Balkans have experienced more than a decade of democratic backsliding.

Social networks and pervasive environmental surveillance via cellphones and the ‘internet of things’ extract minute-by-minute details of our behavior and cognition. This information accumulates into a valuable asset. It then circulates among data brokers, targeted advertisers, political campaigns, and even foreign states as fuel for predictive interventions. Rich gains flow to firms well positioned to leverage these new information aggregates. The privacy losses, economic exploitation, structural inequalities, and democratic backsliding produced by personal data economies, however, fall upon society at large. \n \nThis Article proposes a novel regulatory intervention to mitigate the harms from transforming personal data into an asset. States and municipalities should create “public trusts” as governance vehicles for their residents’ locational and personal data. An asset in “public trust” is owed and managed by the state. The state can permit its use, and even allow limited alienation, if doing so benefits a broad public rather than a handful of firms. Unique among the legal interventions proposed for new data economies, a public trust for data allows a democratic polity to durably commit to public-regarding management of its informational resources, coupled to judicially enforceable limits on private exploitation and public allocation decisions. The public trust itself is a common-law doctrine of ancient roots revived in the Progressive Era as an instrument to protect public assets against private exploitation. Both federal and state courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court, have since endorsed a variety of doctrinal formulations. The result today is a rich repertoire of rules and remedies for the management of common property. Personal data, usefully, has many similarities to assets long managed by public trust. And familiar justifications for creation of a public trust logically extend to personal data. Indeed, municipalities in the United States, Europe, and Canada have started to experiment with limited forms of a public trust in data. Generalizing from those experiences, this Article offers a more general ‘proof of concept’ for how personal data economies can be leashed through the public trust.", :year 2021, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "SSRN Electronic Journal"}, :authors [{:authorId "115254703", :name "Aziz Z Huq"}]} {:paperId "1d43fa07f88f3a91364850f856c6ae76ba8dcf2a", :title "The Fate of A Scholar at the Core of Constitutionalism", :abstract "The article is a detailed review of a collective monograph published in honor of W.Sadurski, a prominent Australian legal scholar of Polish origin. It illuminates the most important problems of concern today to the international legal community. In particular, it is about the coming to power in a number of EU countries of right-wing populists who demonstratively disregard liberal values and tolerant rhetoric; the problems of the EU’s existence within its current borders, aggravated after the UK’s secession from the Union; and the phenomenon of “illiberal democracy” as one of the most dangerous challenges facing the constitutional development of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, especially Hungary and Poland. Special attention is paid to democratic backsliding, seen in the steady decline in rankings of post-socialist countries in various ratings of democratic accountability. The paper draws a conclusion about the general crisis that democratic statehood is experiencing on the European continent today and which is perhaps the most serious since the late 1930s. Also addressed is the broader use of various forms of direct democracy, beginning with nationwide and local referendums and ending with various types of plebiscites on confidence. A relatively new form of popular governance has been introduced by deliberative (consultative) democracy, for example in the case of Ireland’s Citizens’ Assembly, which is chosen by random selection and as vox populi gives parliamentary committees recommendations on the most acute and divisive social problems. The volume also illuminates rightist governments’ social-economic policies repudiating the 1990s’ widely accepted concept of the market’s invisible hand and relying on direct payments to the population (as in Poland’s “500+” program, Covid payments, and so on).

The African continent is part of the trend, although there are distinct regional variances on the continent. Yet, despite democratic gains in some states and along some dimensions of democratic rights, the overall trend is that the democratic gains won in the period after 1990 are now eroding. Democracy is challenged in ways that pose threats to freedom of speech, association, and information, the ability to choose political leaders, protection of personal integrity and private life, and the rule of law with recourse to independent courts. As part of a global trend of democratic backsliding, African states have adopted legal restrictions on key civil and political rights that form the basis of democratic rule in a range of countries, from dominant party regimes such as Zimbabwe, Rwanda, and Tanzania to competitive electoral democracies like Zambia, Senegal, and Malawi. In South Africa, where democracy and rule of law appear deeply institutionalized, the succession battles and exposed levels of corruption under President Zuma, now removed from the leadership of the ANC party, suggest a weakening of the institutions intended to check executive powers. The September 2017 court annulment of the Kenyan elections suggests that the courts were able to perform an important accountability function and safeguard free and fair elections. Yet, the aftermath of the 2017 Kenyan elections culminated in early 2018 with President Uhuru Kenyatta closing down television and radio stations.\n Civil society actors, policy makers, and scholars warn against the democratic backlash and its negative implications for domestic and international politics. Internationally, the African democratic backlash challenges global actors who have long pressured developing countries to politically liberalize. Yet, following what appears to be a global trend of democratic backsliding, space for international influence and the spread of liberal norms is closing rapidly. Domestically, the observed backlash against democracy may pose further social and political threats with wide-reaching implications for development. This may, in turn, challenge the implementation of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Whereas closing space for civil society impacts first and foremost on voice and participation, restrictions on civil society ultimately may curb even the most seemingly apolitical activities such as humanitarian relief. At present, there is limited understanding of possible response mechanisms to the conscious attempts at democratic rollback from political elites. How do activists come together to advocate for particular rights? When are activists more effective in generating mass citizen support for their campaigns?

As a result, it often goes unnoticed by hiding in judicial robes. This makes it harder to categorize regimes and necessitates a greater analytical sensitivity of the indices that many decision-makers – like in our case the European Union – have come to rely on when monitoring and attempting to protect democracy. By exemplifying the workings of autocratic legalism in Hungary and Poland, we firstly discuss what is needed to measure this new type of autocratization and how some of the leading indices fall short in this regard. We secondly discuss how relying on less adequate indices like Polity5 and Freedom House makes it more challenging for authorities like the EU to monitor, criticize, and sanction violations of democratic principles. In arguing that an index like V-Dem would offer a better foundation for tackling the Union’s rule of law conundrum, we stress that the EU’s problems are only in part due to the use of mediocre indices but also linked to increased politicization of democratic backsliding in the EU.", :year 2022, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "Democratization", :pages "551 - 568", :volume "30"}, :authors [{:authorId "2197286524", :name "Regitze Helene Rohlfing"} {:authorId "65827105", :name "Marlene Wind"}]} {:paperId "1ef58839a8e8cf5e5dc3b71dce7004d0812cbde4", :title "The Fragility of Constitutional Democracy", :abstract "Is the survival of constitutional democracy in America at serious risk?

To what extent have their constitutional design innovations contributed to present woes, and conversely, to what extent will the Constitution ensure the survival of democracy? This Essay argues that while the design of the Constitution is both helpful and harmful, much will ultimately turn on the political dimension. In particular, this Essay claims that the republic will survive only if the ongoing practices of democracy re-affirm its central values. But there are significant challenges to maintaining constitutional democracy. In addition to President Trump in the White House, current challenges include the decline in the democratic norms of civility and compromise, the rise of ideological warfare and hyperpartisanship, and the ever-deepening polarization between opposing camps—not only in government but also in the public at large. In the coming years, the continued vigilance and resistance of individuals and institutions will be crucially important to ensure the survival of constitutional democracy in America.

To what extent has the Constitution contributed to present woes? Conversely, to what extent will constitutional structures ensure the survival of democracy? I claim in this Essay that while the structural deficiencies of the Constitution are significant, the outcome will ultimately turn on the political dimension. I am cautiously optimistic that the republic will survive the Trump administration, but my optimism is based on the continued resistance of individuals and institutions. Constitutional democracy will avoid a crisis only if the ongoing practices of democracy reaffirm its central values. This Essay identifies some of these practices of constitutional democracy, and shows how they have eroded key democratic values such as representation and equality. Before considering these democratic practices, this Essay addresses the role of the Constitution in undermining or protecting the structures of democratic government. Given our current fears, it is worth remembering that the Framers, or at least the authors of The Federalist Papers, were notably pessimistic about the survival chances of republican government.

An interesting component of this process of authoritarian turn has been the lack of serious opposition on the part of the opposition parties CHP and IYIP parties to the growing political repression, curtailment of civil liberties and growing consolidation of power in the hands of Erdoğan. In this article, we deal with a major puzzle that emerged in Turkey's politics: how did the AKP regime legitimize its authoritarian transformation of the political system in Turkey in the eyes of CHP and IYIP, despite these parties’ political opposition to the AKP regime and its Islamist agenda? In answering this question, we make use of a causal theory that predicted the intensified use of legitimation claims on the part of the incumbent regimes during authoritarian restructuring. Combining the works of several scholars, we utilize the concept of “missions,” along with ideational narratives, performance objectives and six claims of legitimation to explain how the AKP managed to legitimize its authoritarian grip and regime change even in the eyes of the main opposition parties.", :year 2020, :openAccessPdf {:url "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/13510347.2019.1679772?needAccess=true", :status "HYBRID"}, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "Democratization", :pages "265 - 282", :volume "27"}, :authors [{:authorId "39582659", :name "Ihsan Yilmaz"} {:authorId "117061933", :name "M.

Emphasizing the rule of law and human rights throughout his speech, he reiterated his goal of drafting and ratifying a new constitution to mark the Republic’s centenary in 2023. The constitutional call coincided with developments perpetuating Turkey’s constitutional backsliding, including its move to ban the third largest political party, the pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP), and its withdrawal from the Council of Europe’s Istanbul Convention on the prevention of violence against women and domestic violence (Official Gazette 2021).

While expanding its diplomatic network and public diplomacy apparatus to wield soft power, Turkey’s global reputation has seen a downward spiral. This article investigates the role that political leadership and political values play in determining Turkey’s soft power capacity. This article’s main contention is that while Turkey increases its global engagement and capacity to appeal non-Western audiences, its capacity to attract international audiences particularly in the West has diminished due to its democratic backsliding.", :year 2019, :openAccessPdf {:url "https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0304375419853751", :status "BRONZE"}, :publicationTypes ["Review"], :journal {:name "Alternatives: Global, Local, Political", :pages "50 - 71", :volume "44"}, :authors [{:authorId "117872942", :name "Senem B.

Without examining the broader record, however, it is hard to know whether such tremors presage a global convulsion. A century's worth of evidence (1920–2019) shows that contemporary democracies are sturdier than they look. Above all, high levels of economic development continue to sustain multipartism; OECD democracies have faced less risk than often intimated. Further, competition among political parties, regardless of national affluence, contains a momentum that even the most willful demagogues have had trouble stopping. These economic and institutional bulwarks help explain why democratic backsliding, which seems so portentous, has preceded democratic survival more often than breakdown.

This article aims to explore the possible explanations for this unsatisfactory development from the perspective of informality.The case study is structured in three thematic parts. Firstly, political and social developments in Bulgaria in the postcommunist decades are discussed from an empirical point of view, with particular focus on corruption, electoral participation, citizen trust, and rule of law. Secondly, an attempt is made to examine communist power networks in search of an explanation for the trends of state capture observed today. A key contribution of the article is the conclusion that informal relationships and clientelism are not merely a byproduct of the functioning of the communist system but its very essence.Thirdly, on that basis, conclusions are drawn regarding the possibility for the democratic transformation of Bulgaria and other countries with a similar background.

Among them, Levitsky and Way’s (L&W’s) linkage and leverage theory stands out as one of the most influential. According to Tolstrup, however, their underestimation of domestic agency constitutes a crucial lacuna, which he proposes to fill through the concept of “Gatekeeping Elite” that underlines a significant impact of local actors on the linkage dimension and, consequently, on EDP (in)effectiveness. I believe that Tolstrup’s intuition can be further developed, expanding even more the explanatory power of L&W’s theory. I claim that domestic actors may exert a crucial influence also on the leverage dimension, thanks to “diversionary behaviours” that local elites may use to change external actors’ interests and preferences, persuading them to limit their democratizing pressures and thus reduce their own vulnerability to EDP processes.

Such a trend might be expected to pose significant threats to EMBs. This article contributes new insights through a review of data from the Perceptions of Electoral Integrity and Varieties of Democracy projects. While it finds wide variation in EMB performance and autonomy, there is no overall pattern of decline that might be associated with democratic backsliding in Africa.

However, in some countries, centralization in the name of public health was not the only motive. The COVID-19 response coincided with broader worldwide trends towards democratic backsliding and authoritarian consolidation. Some of these efforts happened while the world was preoccupied with responding to the pandemic without concretely referencing Coronavirus; however, in other cases, public health rationales are clearly and explicitly invoked as a pretext for actions that instead aid the consolidation of regime authority. This has been especially pernicious in subnational democracy, where efforts have been made to undermine the ability of opposition parties to fairly contest in local and regional politics. This paper looks at four cases in which political actors either opportunistically used worldwide distraction from the COVID-19 pandemic or explicitly invoked public health while seeking to undermine long-term domestic contestation in their jurisdictions: Hong Kong, Hungary, Uganda, and the United States.

Furthermore, the discussion of social networks and professional incorporation strategies is an important and original contribution to explaining the remarkable ability of pre-communist elites (and ideas) to withstand decades of communist social engineering efforts. Of course, any work of this scope and theoretical ambition is likely to raise a number of questions. In terms of internal validity, I primarily wondered about two issues. First, I am not sure how to think about the primary dependent variable: Russian democracy. Even leaving aside the dramatic deterioration of the last two decades, post-communist Russia was at best a hybrid regime. And while things looked better in a few subnational enclaves, I am not sure whether the quantitative indicators used in Chapter 7 really capture democracy in the Russian context. The two main indicators—the effective number of candidates and the Vanhanen Index—capture competitiveness, which is essential for democracy. But given that these indicators are based on the first round of the 1996 presidential elections, in which Yeltsin’s main competitor was the Communist Party candidate, Gennady Zyuganov, and where two of his main challengers—Alexander Lebed and Vladimir Zhirinovsky—relied on authoritarian and nationalist appeals, it is unclear that a closer local-level result really means an endorsement of democracy, or simply more competitive authoritarianism. The one genuinely liberal democrat in that election—Grigory Yavlinsky—received only 7.5% of the vote, and his party (Yabloko) never topped 8% in successive parliamentary elections, and while this support was higher in areas with high historical shares of “educated estates,” it nevertheless suggests that support for liberal democracy in Russia was consistently below the population share of the educated estates (roughly 13.5%). This gap suggests that even among the educated and entrepreneurial descendants of the former Czarist elites, democratic support was not particularly high, and raises the possibility that such elites may provide the basis for greater inter-elite competition rather than genuine democratization. A second internal validity question arises from the ambiguity of the meshchane category, which combines occupational elements, education, and urban residence. While Lankina acknowledges and addresses this ambiguity, and the statistical tests attempt to disentangle some of these strands, it would have been useful to test explicitly the relative importance of occupational categories versus the related but distinct factor of pre-communist education/literacy. As with any single-country study, the question of scope conditions/generalizability looms large. The book partially addresses this issue by comparing Russia to two other (ex) communist countries (Hungary andChina) inChapter 10, which broadly confirms the correlation between the resilience of pre-communist elites and post-communist regime patterns. However, such cross-national comparisons also raise many other questions. For example, how would this theoretical framework account for the more democratic regime trajectories of Moldova compared to Russia, despite the lower pre-communist literacy and the greater decimation of Moldovan elites after the communist takeover? Similarly, how do we account for the significant recent democratic backsliding in Hungary and Poland, two countries with the strongest and most resilient precommunist educated elites in the region? That being said—and this final point is admittedly personal and highly impressionistic—I found that the book’s primary theoretical and empirical argument, which focuses on the survival strategies of pre-communist elites after the communist takeover, “travels” very effectively beyond the Russian context. From the emphasis on education investments as a way to compensate for the loss of material capital, to the emphasis on family reunions and belonging to a “good family,” and even all the way to museum employment as a haven for marginalized former educated elites, the book brings to life in a theoretically fascinating and personally moving fashion, an important and often ignored dimension of life under communism. But while these stories are part of the personal baggage for many of us, Lankina’s book tells them at a larger scale, and shows how they help us to understand important aspects of post-communist politics.", :year 2023, :openAccessPdf {:url "https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/3459415A64609015A03E55D7AA2522CD/S1537592723000609a.pdf/div-class-title-span-class-italic-the-genesis-of-rebellion-governance-grievance-and-mutiny-in-the-age-of-sail-span-by-steven-pfaff-and-michael-hechter-new-york-cambridge-university-press-2020-352p-39-99-cloth-div.pdf", :status "BRONZE"}, :publicationTypes ["JournalArticle"], :journal {:name "Perspectives on Politics", :pages "743 - 745", :volume "21"}, :authors [{:authorId "51178962", :name "A.

The budding literature on democratic backsliding, which analyzes the incremental steps through which democracies become less democratic, provides critical insights to understanding labor’s changing fortunes.

Key facts and findings include: • The COVID-19 pandemic arrived in a largely democratic Europe. Only 4 countries in the region (10 per cent) are not democracies, while many of the democracies are high performing. • Democracy in Europe, however, has in recent years experienced erosion and backsliding. More than half of European democracies have eroded in the last 5 years. In particular, 3 countries—Hungary, Poland and Serbia—have registered a more severe form of erosion, called democratic backsliding, with Hungary regressing on its democratic standards for the past 14 years. • The pandemic has intensified these pre-existing concerns. The 3 backsliding countries in Europe have implemented a number of measures to curb the pandemic that are concerning from a democracy standpoint. • The main democratic challenges caused by the pandemic in Europe pertain to the disruption of electoral cycles, curtailment of civil liberties, the use of contact tracing apps, the increase in gender inequality and domestic violence, risks to vulnerable groups, executive aggrandizement, protest waves, corruption cases and challenges in the relationship between local and national governance. • Europe’s democracies have mostly showed resilience, and opportunities for furthering the integrity of elections, for digitalization and for innovative social protests have arisen.

Electoral Cycles of Democratic Satisfaction in Africa", :abstract "Scholars have argued that multiparty elections have a profound and immediate influence on mass evaluations of political support. However, what is less clear is whether the effects of elections are short-lived or long-lasting. Investigating dynamic effects of elections on mass perceptions of political regimes has profound implications on popular foundations of democratic consolidation in an era of democratic backsliding. This paper examines electoral cycles in citizens’ satisfaction with democracy (SWD)–an important dimension of political support–in multiparty regimes. First, we argue that proximity to elections enhances SWD because campaigns and elections include several processes that reduce the costs and increase the benefits of citizen engagement with the political system. This results in a bell-shaped relationship between citizens’ proximity to elections and SWD. Second, we contend that electoral cycles in SWD should vary by the quality of elections and citizens’ winner/loser status. We examine these hypotheses using Afrobarometer data in 34 multiparty regimes between 1999 and 2015 finding compelling support. SWD is higher among respondents surveyed closer to elections, while electoral cycles in SWD are more prominent among winners and around low quality elections.", :year 2022, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes ["Review"], :journal nil, :authors [{:authorId "50720297", :name "Masaaki Higashijima"} {:authorId "115063080", :name "Nicholas Kerr"}]} {:paperId "252b2162084017878fac4100afd29e8f0e0f0d56", :title "Essays on Democracy, Redistribution, and Inequality", :abstract "Economic inequality continues to thrive in democracies across the world. This is puzzling because theory predicts that the ideals of democracy should induce more equal societies. At the same time, high levels of inequality tend to undermine democratic institutions. It may be that many democracies are trapped in a vicious cycle of persistent economic inequality and democratic backsliding, which may be difficult to alter. The purpose of this dissertation is to examine the general question of why inequality persists in democracies with a focus on the means by which the poor can exert political influence to remedy persistent inequality and why they may fail to do so. The dissertation consists of three independent chapters. Each addresses the links between democracy, redistribution and inequality from different angles. In Chapter 1, I examine the general link between democracy and economic inequality by analysing the distributional dynamics of economic growth in democracies relative to autocracies. The chapter shows that democracies are, on average, no better than autocracies when it comes to inclusive economic growth (growth that is associated with a reduction in economic inequality). However, when countries are classified according to their de facto implementation of democratic institutions, liberal democracies do foster inclusive growth in both relative and absolute terms. Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 focus on the political power of the poor to influence redistributive policies in electoral democracies. Each chapter examines different forms of political action that are available to the poor. Chapter 2 focuses on voting and on the impact of clientelism, which may shape how elections serve to channel demand for programmatic redistribution into the political system. The chapter shows that clientelism adversely affects voter support for political candidates regardless of efforts to provide programmatic redistribution. Chapter 3 focuses on protest as an alternative (or complementary) form of political action to influence redistribution when the electoral process is curtailed. The chapter shows that the poor may hold some de facto political power by virtue of protests. However, the magnitude of that power depends on the choice of protest tactics. The dissertation arrives at these novel insights by employing both observational and experimental quantitative research designs with an emphasis on causal inference. The research questions are analysed both across countries and among individual voters in two unequal electoral democracies; Brazil and South Africa. The dissertation adds to the understanding on the causes of equilibria of persistent inequality, low programmatic redistribution, and democratic backsliding, which are liable to emerge when poor citizens are deprived of political power - at the ballot box or in the streets.", :year nil, :openAccessPdf {:url "https://research.cbs.dk/files/95037747/sigrid_koob_phd_series_20_2023.pdf", :status "CLOSED"}, :publicationTypes nil, :journal nil, :authors [{:authorId "122191989", :name "S.

Indeed, the EU is showing no sign of having the rule of law backsliding crisis under control in states such as Hungary and Poland, a decade since the first signs of populist takeovers emerged. Since the foundational values of liberal constitutional democracy were first challenged in these two Central Eastern European (CEE) countries, similar issues in other Member States have also come to light, such as in the Czech Republic and Malta, amongst others. However, little information is available about the democratic stability of other States that also acceded to the EU in 2004. This paper is a stocktaking exercise which aims to address this gap in relation to the fidelity of Latvia to the founding EU value of the rule of law 18 years since it became an EU member. It will examine the state of judicial independence in Latvia during the past few years. Attacks on judicial independence are the main battleground on which the EU is fighting Hungary and Poland, and a value that is considered central to the EU’s understanding of the rule of law. It is important to understand Latvia’s current state of judicial independence in order to build a broader picture of the status of the rule of law in all Member States. This knowledge will help to fight the EU’s rule of law crisis and the rise of populism. This is something that needs to be achieved sooner rather than later so that the EU can stand united against an ever more aggressive Russia to the East.", :year 2022, :openAccessPdf {:url "https://www.cyelp.com/index.php/cyelp/article/download/482/258", :status "GOLD"}, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "Croatian Yearbook of European Law and Policy"}, :authors [{:authorId "2111786913", :name "Beatrice Monciunskaite"}]} {:paperId "2658da3e44829d0f600fed21df9c53d3dd960b59", :title "Vote Secrecy With Diverse Voters", :abstract "Why would incumbent politicians adopt the secret ballot when doing so weakens the advantages of incumbency?

Yet, depending on literacy and electoral rules, it could also narrow political participation. Recognizing this, we endogenize politicians’ preferences over the secret ballot, concentrating on the role of their personal and constituency characteristics.

Desde la entrada en vigor del Tratado de Lisboa y la Carta de Derechos Fundamentales de la UE, diciembre de 2009, las instituciones europeas han disenado y desarrollado estrategias para reforzar el examen de los niveles de respeto a los valores fundacionales y principios constitucionales comunes consagrados en el art.2 TUE («criterios de Copenague). Y para desarrollar instrumentos de prevencion, control y correccion de retrocesos democraticos y en materia de derechos en eventuales reformas constitucionales y legales en los EE.MM. Los casos de Hungria y Polonia resultan paradigmaticos, en la medida en que han suscitado respuestas extraordinarias: entre ellas, la activacion de mecanismos extrajudiciales (el «Mecanismo Estructurado del Estado de Derecho»); la incoacion de acciones por incumplimiento del Derecho europeo por parte de la Comision (art.258 TFUE); una serie Resoluciones del PE solicitando de la Comision y el Consejo la activacion de lo dispuesto en el art.7 TUE.; y, en el caso polaco, importantes decisiones jurisdiccionales del TJ. Este trabajo examina los recientes desarrollos en materia de Rule of Law y la extension del instrumento actualmente disponible hacia un Mecanismo amplio de Estado de Derecho, democracia y derechos fundamentales. Este Mecanismo comprende —en un nuevo Policy Cycle— el escrutinio general, periodico y regular de la legislacion de los EE.MM, apuntandose sanciones extrajudiciales previas a las de «boton nuclear» (de terminacion improbable) del art.7 TUE: asi, la de vincular el acceso a Fondos europeos y presupuestarios de la UE al pleno respeto del Derecho y los derechos fundamentales. El articulo se centra singularmente en el examen a Polonia. Se completa el estudio con una exposicion de las ultimas decisiones del TJ en relacion con las reformas judiciales llevadas a cabo por la mayoria absoluta del ultraconservador partido en el Gobierno polaco (Pis).

As one of the consequences of the protracted EU crisis aroused by the 2009 Great Recession —the deepest and the longest ever throughout the European process—, both the EU and its Member States have witnessed a growing concern about democratic backsliding and fundamental rights backlashes. Since both the Lisbon Treaty and the ECFR entered into force (December 2009, the EU Institutions have developed new strategies to reinforce and strengthen their ability to test Member States Law making standards as to their due respect to common constitutional values and principles, enshrined in art. 2 TEU («Copenhagen Criteria»). By doing that, they have unfolded as well new instruments to prevent, control and correct potential risk of backward steps at the Member States National level, be it via constitutional or via legal reforms. Hungary and Poland are paramount cases, in as much as they have called for: extrajudicial actions (Rule of Law Mechanism); infringement procedures by the Commission (art.258 TFEU), and EP Resolutions calling both the Commission and the Council to initiate art.7 TEU. This Paper examines recent developments in the sphere of Rule of Law, in view of extending its scope to a new Policy Cycle on Rule of Law, Democracy and Fundamental Rights, encompassing overall and regular scrutiny of all of the Member States by means of objective indicators, as a way to overcome the limits (and unlikely outcome) of the so-called «nuclear option» of art. 7 TEU. It builds on the proposal of linking access to EU Funds and budgetary benefits with full compliance with Rule of Law, Democracy and Rights EU standards. This Article focuses mainly on Poland. It adds to an overview and assessment of the latest ECJ rulings on Polish Judicial reforms led by the far conservative ruling Party (PiS), deemed to be incompatible with EU Law.

What explains democratic backsliding in an age of unparalleled international support for democracy? Backsliding occurs when democratic institutions are weakened or eroded by elected officials, resulting in an illiberal or diminished form of democracy. I argue that IOs that support democracy unintentionally make backsliding more likely by neglecting to promote democratic institutions other than executives and elections, increasing executive power, and limiting states’ domestic policy options, which stunts institutional development.

However, some have recently argued that the field has calcified in problematic ways; producing professionalized graduates, restricted perspectives, and standardized techniques that limit its ability to respond to different challenges, and particularly within divergent cultures and contexts. These concerns have found expression in the growth of the “critical peace ” literature over the past decade , which has noted the diversity of conflict-affected s ocieties, the lack of “local ownership” of peace practice, and the need for locally grounded tools for evaluating that practice. In addition, this paper will argue that PCS faces additional challenges today that are quite distinct from the challenges it’s primary theoretical and practical approaches were developed to address. These include demographic shifts within and between nations, the ongoing intensification of both domestic and global inequalities , and democratic backsliding in many contexts, which seem collectively to be contributing to polarization at many scales (domestic, international and global). However, while it is clear that PCS must evolve its existing toolset or develop a new toolset to respond to polarization, the challenges of the “critical peace” literature must also be addressed. Whatever theories and practices PCS develops to overcome issues of polarization must be flexible in response to the diversity of conflict-affected societies, they must provide ownership to local actors, and, pivotally, their processes and outcomes must be evaluated with locally grounded tools. While touching on each of these issues, the paper responds most directly to this last challenge and introduces what we will describe as Indigenous Monitoring & Evaluation (IM&E) processes for this purpose.

Although European settlers' strong organizational position enabled them to demand representative political institutions, the first hypothesis qualifies their impulse for electoral representation by positing the importance of a metropole with a representative tradition. Analyzing new data on colonial legislatures in 144 colonies between the seventeenth and twentieth centuries shows that only British settler colonies—emanating from a metropole with representative institutions—systematically exhibited early elected legislative representation. The second hypothesis highlights a core democratic contradiction in colonies that established early representative institutions. Applying class-based democratization theories predicts perverse institutional evolution—resisted enfranchisement and contestation backsliding—because sizable European settler minorities usually composed an entrenched landed class.

Purported “developmental states”, such as Ethiopia and Rwanda, are argued to possess strong-willed, visionary leaderships whose commitment to delivering on ambitious development plans renders them attractive donor partners. These leaderships are also, however, often authoritarian and unapologetic when criticized for democratic backsliding or human rights abuses. For many Western donors this represents a tolerable trade-off. The purpose of this article is to interrogate, critique and explain the assumptions and ideas underlying this trade-off. Using the case study of Ethiopia, we argue that donor officials’ understandings of “developmental state” are varied, vague and superficial, the main commonality being a “strong” regime with “political will” and a non-negotiable approach to domestic governance. We suggest that donors have too readily and uncritically accepted, internalized and deployed these notions, using the “developmental state” concept to justify their withdrawal from serious engagement on democratic reform. This derives from a systemic donor preference for depoliticized development models, as well as from Ethiopian officials’ own savvy political manoeuvrings.

Further, economic hardship moderates these relationships: it strengthens both the negative effect of ethnic national identities and, to some extent, the positive effect of civic national identities on democracy support vis-à-vis authoritarian alternatives.

While contestation over women’s rights is a far from new phenomenon, over the past two decades opposition to gender equality has become better organized at the transnational level, mobilizing a dispersed set of state and non-state actors, and is becoming more successful in halting the progress of women’s rights. I argue that the position of oppositional actors vis-a-vis women rights activism appears to be strengthened by two recent political developments: democratic backsliding and the closure of civic space. Some preliminary findings show how these interrelated developments lead to an erosion of women’s rights at the national level. Governments use low key tactics to dismantle institutional and implementation arrangements and sideline women’s organisations. Next, I explore the implications of these developments for gender equality norms at the national and international level.

To investigate the recent events related to the MND, this study examined 615 news articles throughout 2018 and 2019 to identify how the news media framed the events associated with the MND and the Prespes Agreement. The results revealed that most news stories framed the MND incidents as a political or mobilization tool of the public and an existential threat to Greece. Furthermore, the news coverage showed that several news stories employed the patriotic and nationalistic frame to support or undermine the country’s then-government. These findings offer insights into the use of territorial name disputes as a communication tool, how news articles and journalism promote the idea of an existential threat connected to the MND, and the alarming non-critical news coverage that could lead to a further democratic backsliding of Greece.", :year 2022, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "The Communication Review", :pages "152 - 180", :volume "25"}, :authors [{:authorId "123906313", :name "Minos-Athanasios Karyotakis"}]} {:paperId "2c79ab5ede79976f77244663679cd4f34d99aa2f", :title "Enforcing peoples’ right to democracy: transnational activism and regional powers in contemporary Inter-American relations", :abstract "The Inter-American Democratic Charter (IADC) is the most comprehensive multilateral framework for dealing with democratic breakdowns and backslidings in the Western Hemisphere. In such cases, the Organisation of American States (OAS) is supposed to defend democracy by suspending states, imposing sanctions or taking other multilateral measures. Oftentimes, however, the OAS has looked the other way. The question, then, is what makes the difference. In this comparative case study, we use cross-cases comparisons and process-tracing to identify the actors and causal mechanisms that determine when and whether the IADC is actually enforced. We explain inconsistent enforcement by analysing interactions among three sets of actors – the governments of powerful member states, OAS secretaries general and civil society organisations – during coups, executive takeovers and electoral frauds in OAS member states between 2001 and 2020. Our analysis reveals that cooperation between an activist secretary general and civil society actors was neither sufficient nor necessary for IADC enforcement. By contrast, US support for enforcement was a necessary but insufficient condition for the OAS to act. To get it to do so, the United States required the support of two leading regional powers: Mexico and Brazil. These findings suggest that the ‘right to democracy’ enshrined in the IADC hinges upon the volatile preferences of the executives of the OAS’s three most powerful member states. The resulting lack of institutional autonomy leads to inconsistent enforcement of the IADC, jeopardising the credibility of the region’s formally declared right to democracy.", :year 2022, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes ["JournalArticle"], :journal {:name "European Journal of International Relations", :pages "780 - 805", :volume "29"}, :authors [{:authorId "2246074217", :name "Stefano Palestini"} {:authorId "2190363676", :name "Erica Martinelli"}]} {:paperId "2cc0547b5d408e8abcccd42866f215789dcc5acb", :title "Democratic Erosion, Populist Constitutionalism and the Unconstitutional Constitutional Amendment Doctrine", :abstract "The recent phenomenon of democratic backsliding is characterized, among other things, by what has been referred to in the literature as “constitutional capture”, “constitutional retrogression”, “abusive constitutionalism” or “populist constitutionalism”. These terms describe the practices by which populist politicians, once in power, employ constitutional law to promote their goals and weaken the state’s democratic values, mechanisms and institutions. \n \nWe examine the applicability of the Unconstitutional Constitutional Amendment doctrine (“the Doctrine”) in the context of democratic backsliding. We argue that the Doctrine has the potential of guarding against the use of constitutional change tools to undermine democracy. However, we also argue that the characteristics of democratic backsliding present special challenges for the application of the Doctrine. \n \nThe first challenge derives from the incremental nature of democratic backsliding, which renders it difficult to identify the benchmark for applying the Doctrine. The second challenge regards the shortcomings of the Doctrine in responding to constitutional replacement, and, more broadly, the allegedly limited justifications for applying the doctrine when constitutional changes are made using direct democracy measures, such as referendums. The third challenge derives from the manner in which populist constitutionalism targets the judiciary. \n \nWe outline and analyse these challenges and offer guiding principles and adjustments for applying the Doctrine in response to democratic backsliding. We distinguish between normative and strategic considerations for applying the Doctrine, and while we do not dismiss the latter, we focus on the former. With regards to the challenge of incrementalism, we argue that Courts should consider the accumulative or aggregated effects of a series of constitutional amendments. With regards to constitutional replacements or amendments that were adopted following direct democracy measures, we argue that Courts should focus on examining the depth and inclusiveness of the process.

Since popular protests broke out in 2011, institutional reforms were implemented under the leadership of the monarchy, leading the Moroccan polity to change without altering its defining features. The previous decade had indeed seen Morocco trailing a thin line between social moderation and repression and between political openings and counter-revolution. Between 2011 and 2022 the process of democratic backsliding accelerated, thus turning Morocco into a ‘hybrid regime'. By tracing continuities and changes in the past decade mainly at the political and institutional levels, this article explores the pattern of democratic backsliding undertaken by Morocco by empirically contextualising it within the deterioration of the main features of citizenship understood according to the categorisation introduced by Marshall and Bottomore (1987) that distinguishes between civic, political and social rights. To explain this pattern, the article argues that external factors linked to the deterioration of the regional context (the conflict with Algeria over the Western Sahara and the spill-over of Libyan instability) as well as the rising tensions with the European Union (EU) have not only underpinned Morocco’s geopolitical reorientation but also sustained its domestic crisis of (unfinished) democratisation.", :year 2023, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes ["JournalArticle"], :journal {:name "The Journal of North African Studies", :pages "1492 - 1514", :volume "28"}, :authors [{:authorId "46465041", :name "S.

Eschewing a focus on current events, this Article develops a taxonomy of different threats of democratic backsliding, the mechanisms whereby they unfold, and the comparative risk of each threat in the contemporary moment. By drawing on comparative law and politics experience, we demonstrate that there are two modal paths of democratic decay. We call these authoritarian reversion and constitutional retrogression. A reversion is a rapid and near-complete collapse of democratic institutions. Retrogression is a more subtle, incremental erosion to three institutional predicates of democracy occurring simultaneously: competitive elections; rights of political speech and association; and the administrative and adjudicative rule of law. We show that over the past quarter-century, the risk of reversion in democracies around the world has declined, whereas the risk of retrogression has spiked. The United States is neither exceptional nor immune from these changes. We evaluate the danger of retrogression as clear and present here (and elsewhere), whereas we think reversion is much less likely. We further demonstrate that the constitutional safeguards against retrogression are weak. The nearterm prospects of constitutional liberal democracy hence depend less on our institutions than on the qualities of political leadership, popular resistance, and the quiddities of partisan coalitional politics.", :year 2019, :openAccessPdf {:url "https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=13666&context=journal_articles", :status "GREEN"}, :publicationTypes nil, :journal nil, :authors [{:authorId "115254703", :name "Aziz Z Huq"} {:authorId "2487499", :name "Tom Ginsburg"}]} {:paperId "2f1ac21dcbb24b6432527a3b80583ce88c73c357", :title "Dependent development and authoritarian state capitalism: Democratic backsliding and the rise of the accumulative state in Hungary", :abstract nil, :year 2019, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "Geoforum", :volume ""}, :authors [{:authorId "6015464", :name "G.

While news media cannot deliver policy on their own, they are fully equipped to represent, interpret, and amplify grievance. If disaffection is directed at retribution rather than policy, journalism contributes to backsliding in the further pathologizing of (non)-responsive government. This essay proposes critical realism (CR) as a heuristic for conceptualizing unique contributions of news media to backsliding. Reality consists of layered strata in CR. This approach accepts the premise of news as a social construction but maintains that a domain of reality exists independent of discursive representation, and that this realm can be actualized in ways that are damaging to democracy. Applied to political communication, the domain of the real includes democratic deficits that may or may not become actualized depending on how journalism operates at the empirical level. Critical realism also generates insights applicable to reform. CR insists that journalists avoid reifying sentiment in ways that comfort authoritarians. The diagnostic acknowledges the journalistic conviction that an external reality is knowable, positing nevertheless that the news interacts with underlying social forces. The profession must forge a healthier relationship with the public to avoid reifying audience support for anti-democratic norms. Reflexivity could be directed beyond the recognition of complicity to two productive rationales for safeguarding democracy: liberal multiculturalism and journalistic paternalism.

Evidence for this proposition comes primarily from hypothetical survey experiments with relatively weak treatments.

The insurrection was unexpected to the general public, did not coincide with other events that could plausibly affect public opinion, and occurred while Gallup was conducting a nationally representative survey using random digit dialing. Comparing vote choice intention among respondents that were interviewed just before, and just after, the insurrection occurred suggests that the insurrection caused a 10.8% decline in support for the Republican Party, and an 8.4% increase in support for the Democratic Party.

Few, however, have focused on whether democracies may still embrace constitutionalism mixed with illiberal elements. This article explores mixed constitutions of South Korea and Taiwan, the two democracies with vibrant civil societies in East Asia. Three distinctive features in both constitutions have demonstrated illiberal elements, including duty clauses imposed upon citizens, directives requiring the State to enact laws to fulfill the goals of governance, and constitutional cultures that exhibit high deference to political elites based on the Confucian tradition. This article further examines the impacts of such mixed constitutions on three challenging issues: managing pandemic crisis, applying artificial intelligence, and combating fake news. This article finds mixed features of illiberal and democratic constitutions in the two countries by giving their governments more space in managing urgent crises, showing higher deference to experts who are generally trusted by the public, and making compromises to individual rights for greater public good. However, this does not imply that the government is not made democratically accountable, or rights and freedoms are not asserted or valued by individuals. To the contrary, nongovernmental organizations and courts in the two countries continue to act as a counterbalancing force, challenging the government’s policies and decisions if not reasonably balanced, weakening the tendency of power concentration that has been seen in other countries where democratic backsliding or authoritarian governance is gradually revived.", :year 2022, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "The Law & Ethics of Human Rights", :pages "273 - 294", :volume "16"}, :authors [{:authorId "97561171", :name "Yi-Li Lee"} {:authorId "50310060", :name "Wen-Chen Chang"}]} {:paperId "30bf991f7964c0e7b9ec37ebd67714424a64593d", :title "European political parties’ complicity in democratic backsliding", :abstract "Abstract This article discusses the contribution of European political parties to democratic backsliding.

Furthermore, it attempts to explain why Orbán's brand of conservative illiberalism has emerged as a normative ideal for a number of Bulgarian political parties, including the Bulgarian socialists after 2016. The paper argues that so-called ‘democratic backsliding' in CEE, and Bulgaria more specifically, cannot be understood without acknowledging the role of decommunization for the rehabilitation and rise of far-right nationalist discourses. Within a common framework of capitalist free markets and decommunization, a series of ideological ‘slippages' from 1990s liberalism to post-2008 conservatism has taken place. It is the consistent backsliding of left-wing thought in Bulgaria that has made a critique of liberalism possible mainly from a conservative point of view, even for the socialists. Third, the paper argues that while Bulgarian politicians praise Orbán and his conservative illiberalism on the domestic scene, they pay lip service to liberal values in their international discourse, pre-empting in this way criticism from the EU. It is precisely Orbán's open normative ideological challenge that has made Hungary the ‘poster child’ of illiberalism distracting attention away from his political followers in countries such as Bulgaria.", :year 2021, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "European Politics and Society", :pages "59 - 76", :volume "24"}, :authors [{:authorId "116402853", :name "J.

This article contributes to the current debate on autocratization by providing a detailed discussion on the topic of resistance and a definition that can be operationalized for empirical research. It also addresses this issue in a comparative perspective by analysing resistance against autocratization across different types of political regimes, therefore overcoming the narrow focus on democratic backsliding in democratic regimes.

In other words, democracy is a people-oriented form of political governance in which the welfare of citizens is always at the heart of the programs and policies of the government in power. Unfortunately, violence and insecurity of lives and property in emerging democratic countries of Arica, particularly the present-day Nigeria, have taken their tolls on the citizens’ psyche and have proved to be the greatest roadblocks on the way to real nation-building. Using Nigeria as a case-study, a return from military dictatorship to a liberal democratic regime on May 29, 1999, was expected to usher the country into the 21st century of good governance, preservation of fundamental human rights, respect for the sacredness of human life, development and progress, peace and security as opposed to the current culture of violence, insecurity and destruction of human lives and property. Alas it is as if Nigeria as a political entity is steadily backsliding into Thomas Hobbes’ “state of nature” – “a condition of war of every one against every one,” in which human life has become ‘nasty, brutish, and short.’1 Thus, as Henry Umoru observes, it is frightening that the former President Obasanjo and the leaders of different socio-political groups from six geo-political zones in Nigeria – the AFANIFERE, OHANEZE, PANDEF, NEF, have come to the conclusion in their recent communique that “the government lacked the capacity to arrest the drift towards a state of anarchy that looms in the country as a result of the security challenges in the country.”2 In this excursion down memory lane, we shall attempt a survey of the emergence of violence in Nigeria’s polity from the colonial era down to the nascent liberal democratic civilian dispensation which began with President Shehu Shagari’s brief democratic regime that was interrupted by 34 years of military interregnum, and from President Olusegun Obasanjo’s democratic regime (the 4th Republic, 1999) down to the current President Muhammadu Buhari’s democratic government. We underline here that the current spates of violence and insecurity of lives and property in different parts of Nigeria, but especially in the North-East, North-West and the North-Central states, necessitates this survey. The aim is to remind political leaders in Africa, and Nigeria in particular, that unjust political actions and inactions, more often than not, result in violence and insecurity and loss of citizens’ lives and property to the detriment and derailment of efforts towards nation-building. Based on this crucial point of view, our conception of violence will broadly include communal (ethnic or religious) conflicts, inter-party and intra-party violence, electoral violence, all manners of political thuggery and undemocratic practices which have always resulted in gruesome assassination of perceived political opponents or enemies, all forms of insurgency, such as the Niger-Delta militancy, Boko Haram insurgency and the cattle herdsmen and farmers conflicts that have resulted in mindless destruction of lives and property in different parts of Nigeria in recent years. Before we delve further into the menace of violence and insecurity in Nigeria, I would think that it is strategically important to define first the concept of nation-building.", :year 2020, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes ["Review"], :journal {:name "", :volume "19"}, :authors [{:authorId "121058444", :name "S.

Yet Latin American courts seem to be countering this larger trend. The three largest countries in the region—Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia—have produced robust institutions able to check leaders with authoritarian tendencies, with high courts playing a fundamental role. In a dramatic succession of recent cases, courts in these three countries have been innovative, acted with a high degree of independence, and appear legitimately interested in defending democratic norms. All of this is profoundly surprising. There is little to no track record of independent Latin American judiciaries that stand in the way of authoritarian governments. Closer study of these three countries is therefore critical for scholars and practitioners, who are otherwise locked in debates over the importance of judicial review in preserving democracy. After dozens of judicial reform failures since the 1990s, we may be observing some overdue success.

Drawing on the political science and sociology literatures on institutional trust in non-democratic contexts, we develop hypotheses linking public trust in the military to personal safety, political interest, Islamist orientation, trust in institutions, regionalism, and support for democracy. Using survey data collected by the Arab Barometer between 2014 and 2019, we empirically test these hypotheses. Our findings reveal a confluence of factors driving trust in the military in Libya, including regional, generational, educational, and class divides. Being older, male, and from the East contribute positively to trust in the military as well as perceived personal safety, trust in government, interest in politics, and support for democracy. On the other hand, an Islamist orientation, education and income are negatively correlated. These results allow us to speculate about the drivers of trust in the military. In particular, the positive impact of personal safety and support for democracy could reflect the public's perception of the army as responsible for ensuring safety and protecting a nation in turmoil. The role of interest in politics could be attributed to the charged context of politics and security after the 2014 elections. Notably, regional exceptionalism in the East could be related to the role and behaviour of the eastern-based, self-proclaimed Libyan National Army.

Why do some bureaucrats engage in voice and guerrilla sabotage to thwart policies against the public interest under “unprincipled principals,” yet others do not?

We address this gap with survey evidence from 1,700 Brazilian public servants during the Temer Presidency, widely perceived to lack democratic legitimacy and integrity. We focus on one key explanator: public service motivation (PSM). We argue that bureaucrats with greater PSM are more likely to engage in voice and sabotage of “unprincipled policies,” and exit to avoid implementing “unprincipled policies.” Structural equation models support these hypotheses. Public service-motivated bureaucracies are thus short-run stalwarts against “unprincipled” political principals.

Therefore Hungary may offer itself as a worst case scenario, even when looking back until 2010, but it is much more so, if the period the incumbent Orban government has also been taken into account. The Democracy Index 2011 has put it clearly: \"Some negative trends have recently got worse. Hungary perhaps the prime example among the EU's new member states in the region.\" (DI, 2011: 21). The Freedom House Report, Nations in Transit 2013 has supported this view when it has evaluated the backsliding of democracy in the \"New EU States\": \"the most prominent example of this phenomenon may be Hungary, whose Nation in Transit rates have weakened more since EU accession than those of any other member state, with the largest decline in 2010 and 2011. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Viktor Orban the conservative Fidesz party has used its parliamentary supermajority to increase political control over a number of key political institutions, most notably the judiciary and the media regulator.\" (FH, 2013: 6). Thus, this paper asks about the special reasons for this Hungarian worst case scenario, i.e. how Hungary has become from the trendsetter in the late eighties the latecomer, the worst performer in the early 2010s. No doubt that the international ranking institutions have shown similar worrying tendencies of the \"backsliding of democracy\" in all new democracies due to the global crisis, since the \"Global backsliding in democracy has been evident for some time\" (DI, 2011: 2). The titles of the Freedom House Reports and the Democracy Index of the Economist Intelligence Unit have indicated this trend (see FH, 2011a,b and FH, 2013 as well as DI, 2010, 2011 and 2013). Still the general framework to analyse the Hungarian development can only be the group of the New Member States, above all the eight NMS from Poland to Bulgaria where this tendency has also been pointed out in the above Reports at length and in depth. Therefore, for the proper analysis of the particular features in the Hungarian developments, it is necessary to compare them in their major points and on their key issues with the NMS developments in general. But this paper does not claim to give a general picture of the NMS case and it restricts itself to the analysis of Hungary. (3) The most intriguing issue in this paper is why and how a deep change took place at the 2010 elections producing the two-thirds, constitution-making majority of Fidesz that led to some kind of backsliding democracy during the incumbent government as the latest Nations in Transit Report has emphasized. Simply said, the main problem in the Hungarian case is not the \"parliamentary supermajority\" in itself but the abuse of this majority by violating the checks and balances system, i.e. seeking \"political control over a number of key political institutions\". There have been many political analyses about the decline of the Hungarian democracy in the Orban government. Hungary has also become ill famed in the international media. But the main issue has remained unanswered so far: why did the voters give confidence in 2010 to a national-social populist party in Hungary after twenty years of democratization, i.e. why millions of Hungarians were so disillusioned, so exhausted and so desperate that they abstained at the elections or supported this \"constitutional coup d'etat\" as the abuse of \"parliamentary supermajority\" against the young democracy. (4) Instead of simply arguing about the widespread discontent with the \"democratic mess\", this paper goes deeper to discover the long process of the socio-economic crisis that generated the protracted political crisis and its cumulative effects led to the \"rupture\" in 2010. …", :year 2013, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "Romanian Journal of Political Science", :pages "25-51", :volume "13"}, :authors [{:authorId "103647739", :name "A.

Importantly, such episodes unfold over time, and often involve uncertainty about the ultimate intentions of governments. Governments typically do not attempt to engage in authoritarian practices immediately, but rather initiate policies or institutional reforms that may in the future facilitate or enable actions that are inconsistent with liberal democratic practices. Building on recent work by Milan Svolik (2018), we develop a formal model that explores both features (and their interaction) in a two-period game in which a government takes an action in period 1 that may allow for subsequent actions that are inconsistent with the rule of law in period 2. Citizens face uncertainty over the ultimate intentions of the government, and must decide whether to replace the first-period government before period 2. The model generates several insights. First, consistent with other work (e.g., Svolik 2018), it suggests that polarization among citizens and elites is an important factor in driving authoritarian backsliding. Extending this logic, the model demonstrates that the degree of polarization necessary to generate the potential for backsliding depends critically on the uncertainty facing citizens about the type of incumbent. Finally, in such a setting, citizens may support incumbent governments even if there is some risk that these governments are “closet autocrats” despite the fact that citizens are fundamentally opposed to authoritarianism. One consequence is that in our model, citizens may genuinely come to regret their electoral choices—a marked contrast from models in which citizens accept authoritarian outcomes because on balance these are preferable to the alternative. We illustrate the model’s implications through an analytic narrative that focuses on the current Polish government’s efforts to reform the Polish judiciary.", :year 1995, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal nil, :authors [{:authorId "96041744", :name "M.

Based on this argument, the paper qualifies Hungary as an “externally constrained hybrid regime”. However, the EU does not only fulfil system constraining functions regarding the Hungarian regime, but performs system support and system legitimation functions as well.

At the state level, zoning nevertheless remains a cardinal rule, determining the balance of power between each states three senatorial districts. State-level power sharing helps shape national political dynamics; governors exert significant influence over national policy and skim multi-billion dollar budgets to build personal war chests.

Is there a correlation between equitable power rotation and improved democracy and governance outcomes? Conversely, is political violence and poor governance more prevalent in states where zoning has unraveled? Looking ahead, will state-level power rotation persist?

Over the last century the world has seen several waves of democratization in the developing world. Despite expectations, the quality of these democracies has in many cases disappointed citizens and political onlookers alike. Rather than resulting in accountable and responsive governance, many countries still report high levels of corruption, lowering voters’ trust and satisfaction with democracy. Research has sought to explain why democratic success or backsliding varies across countries, but has focused largely on formal institutions and their ability to constrain behavior, neglecting the role of informal rules and norms in influencing elite corruption in the long term. I argue that the quality of democratic governance following transition depends on the legacy of authoritarianera informal institutions. When ex-authoritarian elites assume positions of power under democracy, they reproduce the informal rules and norms that structured their past behavior. To the extent that these rules and norms support democracy, elites will pursue accountable governing practices. More often, however, authoritarian-era informal institutions are incompatible with democratic principles and will encourage elites to engage in corrupt, non-accountable behavior. I test my argument using a cross-sectional time series, focusing on young democracies in Europe, Latin America, and Africa.

While both prove incompatible with democratic backsliding, they challenge the legitimacy of the strong assertions of federal authority some advocate to tackle it.

A fuzzy-set Qualitative Analysis of positions towards backsliding in Hungary (since 2010) and Romania (in 2012) finds that party politics do, indeed, matter, but that they cannot be reduced to ideological distance (in Left/Right terms). Preferences about sanctions are the result of conjectural causation, in which parties’ commitment to liberal democracy as well as their attitudes towards European integration also play a role.

First, the EU's half-baked system of party politics and its ingrained reluctance to interfere in the domestic politics of its member states help shield national autocrats from EU intervention. Second, funding and investment from the EU helps sustain these regimes. Third, the free movement of persons in the EU facilitates the exit of dissatisfied citizens, which depletes the opposition and generates remittances, thereby helping these regimes endure.

Enlargement literature generally treats Turkey as a sui generis case for reasons such as geographic location and religious background. This paper, however, considers Turkey a sui generis case for a different reason: it is the only candidate country so far to transition away from, rather than towards, democracy. The main aim of this paper is to address whether the deterioration of the prospects of Turkish accession to the EU has been more the result of Turkish or EU actions. By analyzing the development of Turkish accession through changes over time of indicators of democratic backsliding and economic interdependence between Turkey and the EU, the paper shows which actor has caused the pulling back of relations in a given time period. This study aims to fill a gap in enlargement theory by analyzing a factor traditionally overlooked, regime change. Preliminary empirical observations show that, as Turkey progressed from asymmetric to symmetric economic interdependence with the EU, accession conditions began to delay until the halt we witness today. The analysis demonstrates that, with Turkey sliding towards illiberal democracy and progressing independently as a growing economic power, the EU has lost the leverage it once had over Turkey. This outcome allows some predictions on the future of the EU-Turkish relationship and the possible paths it may continue upon. Presented at the Transatlantic Students’ Conference Addressing Diplomatic, Economic, and Migration Challenges in Southeastern Europe James Madison University Florence, 23-27 April 2018 2 When determining the success of the European Union (EU), many point to enlargement as a key example of how the EU has fostered cooperation and spread peace across the continent. They give the European Union credit as a normative power diffusing values of democracy, respect of human rights, and free market economies to member and potential member states alike. As the European Union has grown, it has widened (increased the number of member states) and deepened (increased its competences) thus making it more challenging institutionally to make decisions. In particular, enlargement which requires unanimous voting across member states is extremely difficult and many scholars theorize that “enlargement fatigue” has occurred and predict the EU has possibly reached its cap in membership. As more EU members have joined and struggled with implementation of EU law after admittance in particular Eastern European countries, it has led to a growing field of criticism against EU enlargement. Some critics have suggested that EU candidate status has produced political consolidation in candidate countries while trying to complete the acquis communautaire leading to a frustration among citizens, further widening of the democratic deficit, and rise of populist parties and technocracy. Turkey has always proven to be the most controversial candidate country of the European Union. First admitted as a candidate in 1999, Turkey has closed more chapters than other candidate countries totaling 16. However, Turkey has become a unique EU candidate as it is now in danger of potentially having to stall or halt accession entirely. Since the reign of President Erdogan, public support of EU membership has declined. In the past, the EU was able to use a carrot and stick approach by incentivizing Turkey to cooperate by soliciting the potential 1 Hiski Haukkala, “The European Union as a Regional Normative Hegemon: The Case of European Neighbourhood Policy.” Europe-Asia Studies, vol. 60, no. 9, 2008, pp. 1601–1622. 2 Ferdinando Nelli Feroci, “EU Enlargement Policy: From Success to Fatigue.” The Frontiers of Europe: A Transatlantic Problem?, eds.

Recently, the EU has continuously postponed the accession progress of Turkey and the carrots it can offer have declined as well as the perceived benefits of membership. Today accession has come to a boiling point as certain EU officials have demanded all accession funds be cut due to concerns of human rights violations within Turkey after the coup attempt of 2016. There is large debate on what effect being an EU member has had on the evolution of Turkish politics. Supporters of Turkish accession believe that being an EU member has caused Turkey to pursue more liberal democratic policies than it would have on its own due to the desire to join the EU such as removing the death penalty. On the contrary, others have argued that the EU had little influence on the progression of Turkey suggesting that the “Europeanization” of Turkey’s was a strategic decision by the AKP party, rather than a result of wanting to become an EU member. This implies that Turkey would have evolved in the same way it has today had it never been an EU candidate country. This paper aims to put these two phenomena of decline of the EU-Turkish accession relationship and the impact of the EU on Turkish policy creation to determine which actor, the EU or Turkey, is more to blame for the deteriorative relationship. The paper is organized in the following order. It begins by introducing existing literature on EU enlargement and what factors lead to accession. We then discuss why Turkey is treated as a sui generis case and excluded from enlargement literature. Through our methods and application section, we demonstrate what independent variables we will be testing and state our hypothesis on the evolution of Turkish EU accession.

In many countries, including EU members and their close neighbours, we can observe the so called democratic backsliding in the current decade. Political scientists have been discussing intensively the reasons behind this process. The proposed paper focuses on the rising phenomenon of majoritarianism which seems to contribute to the problems of democratic governance - particularly in the polarised and diverse societies in terms of the world outlook, beliefs and political sympathies -because of the dominance of a particular political and social group or groups in a political system. The aim of the article is to analyse different paths of development of majoritarianism in the 1990s and the 2000s and its impact on the political regime in the current decade. The case of Turkey as one of the “hardest\" cases to indicate the phenomenon is compared to some selected states from Central Europe to verify the main hypothesis that the structural factors emerging within the historical process are behind the development of majoritarianism, which has been even strengthened in the current decade, including the pandemic period in 2020. Methods and materials . The author takes the qualitative approach. He uses the process-tracing method to investigate the development of majoritarianism in selected states and conducts the comparative analysis to identify the similarities and differences between Turkey and two Central European states - Hungary and Poland with reference to the analysed phenomenon. Results. At the turn of the 1990s and the 2000s a concentration of the party system, producing a decrease in the number of parties in the parliament and a rising party system polarization that strengthened the two largest parties and developed two ideological blocks resulted in the development of majoritarianism in the 2000s - mainly in Turkey and Hungary. It did not lead to the democracy decline at this time. In the second decade of the 21st century single-party governments (or coalition governments with one dominating party) sharing the majoritarian understanding of democracy have consolidated their power at the cost of the weakening of the opposition as well as have strengthened the executive - in relation to the legislature and judiciary. These processes have led to limitations in working of checks and balances system but also political and social pluralism due to increasing dominance of incumbents in political and social life of analyzed countries, particularly during the pandemic period. Discussion and conclusions . In Hungary and Poland the phenomenon of ma-joritarianism contributes so far to lowering the quality of democracy - in comparison with the Turkish situation reflecting rather the gradual change of the political regime to less democratic (i.e. a new type of authoritarianism).", :year 2020, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "", :pages "17-24", :volume "16"}, :authors [{:authorId "2042129847", :name "А.

The dream of a global order where authoritarianism was an increasingly rare form of rule seemed realizable as dictatorships crumbled in region after region—Southern Europe, Latin America, Eastern Europe, East Asia, Africa and, even for a spring moment, the Middle East. And in established democracies the reactionary anti-democratic right had not been a serious contender for power since the end of the Second World War, except perhaps in Austria. The collapse of communism in Eastern Europe had also worked to undermine the viability of an anti-democratic left. Latin America had moved from a region seen as prone to chronic military coups to one that was almost universally democratic. In no time at all, or so it seemed, Castro would pass in Cuba, and things could be set right in Haiti. Though Latin American democracy was far from perfect, progress was being made in several countries on such nagging problems as poverty and persistent violent insurgency. The new challenges to democracy were not whether the colonels would stay in the barracks, but rather the weakness of horizontal accountability, the full integration of indigenous populations, and the strengthening of the rule of law. Clearly we were too optimistic. Today Venezuela, historically one the region’s most durable democracies, has collapsed into dictatorship and a profound humanitarian crisis. President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua has amended the constitution to allow himself a third presidential term. The one-time guerilla leader of the Sandinista Front for the Liberation of Nicaragua has a personal fortune estimated at $50 million, and stood for office with his wife as his vice-presidential running mate in 2016. He has moved from building socialism to crony capitalism. And in Brazil, the region’s biggest economy and dominant power, almost all important political forces seem discredited by allegations of corruption. In Europe, fun was once poked at the retrograde communist-style dictatorship of Belarusan President Alyaksandr Lukashenka, who was said to rule “the last European dictatorship.” Triumphalism in Europe was grounded in confidence in the future of the European Union, which by incorporating sets of states further removed from its West European core, would presumably share the blessings of consolidated democracy, universal respect for human rights, and higher living standards. This seemed attainable in our lifetimes—at least, until the rise of Putin, the Euro crisis, Brexit, and the backlash against a massive influx of refugees shattered the dream. Perhaps Lukashenka was merely the first of a new wave of petty dictators. Since the current European crisis, Poland and Hungary, two of the poster children for EU adoption, have experienced substantial backsliding with the latter perhaps even having fully regressed to authoritarianism. Even more disturbing is the rise of rightwing populist parties and movements in almost all the core countries of the EU. And in some cases they are in government, such as the Freedom Party in Austria, and potentially the Northern League in Italy. It would appear that the enduring political lesson of World War II—that overt racist and xenophobic leaders are the road to catastrophe— has been, with the passing of the generations, unlearned by larger and larger parts of the populations even in developed countries that experienced the worst of the conflagration. Authoritarianism persists in two different ways. First, countries that have alternated between periods of unconsolidated democracy and dictatorship continue to oscillate between these two dominant forms of modern rule—e.g., Venezuela, Nicaragua, Hungary, and Turkey. In this sense we seem to be in a reverse wave in the global movement of regime types over time. The problem of these waves and counter-waves of regime change is addressed in one of the articles in this issue of Perspectives, “Democratic Waves in Historical Perspective,” by Seva Gunitsky. He pays careful attention to the international dimensions of waves of regime change, both in terms of sources for the impetus of the changes and their strength. The issue of international regime diffusion is also a component of the current resurgence of authoritarianism, in particular, the weakening of the role of the United States in upholding international norms. This development harkens back to the nightmare of the interwar era where revisionist powers undermined the global liberal order because of the withdrawal of the United States from collective security arrangements.

These democratizing forces of Turkish politics could be discussed with a stronger emphasis on their implications for the recent democratic backsliding in addition to the extensive historical account of them.

I find a significant difference in the depth of democracy between democratic regimes forged from nonviolent resistance (NVR) campaigns and those born from violent revolutions and elite-led top-down liberalizations. This effect is statistically significant for up to ten years following the transition.

There are formidable obstacles to using the one political safeguard that entails material sanctions, namely Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). Moreover, the experience of the EU’s pre-accession conditionality suggests that even a credible threat of material sanctions is least effective the more severe the breaches of liberal democracy. However, EU interventions without material leverage are not necessarily doomed, as the case of Romania in 2012 shows. Under favourable conditions the EU can thus elicit governments to repeal illiberal practices by relying primarily on social pressure and persuasion. This contribution assesses to what extent novel instruments that EU institutions have developed to confront democratic backsliding meet the requirements for effective social influence. It argues that the Commission’s Rule of Law Framework has potential because it meets the criteria of formalization, publicity and impartiality. Yet, to increase the likelihood of influence, it needs to be applied more consistently and should be embedded in a process of regular monitoring through a democracy scoreboard covering all member states.", :year 2017, :openAccessPdf {:url "http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/68112/1/Sedelmeier_Political%20safeguards_2016.pdf", :status "GREEN"}, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "Journal of European Public Policy", :pages "337 - 351", :volume "24"}, :authors [{:authorId "104296624", :name "Ulrich Sedelmeier"}]} {:paperId "3a27ce95db8421f3780ba287072ac018749945be", :title "Democratic Hypocrisy: Polarized citizens support democracy-eroding behavior when their own party is in power", :abstract "AbstractWith a decade of democratic backsliding in the world and the polarization-driven institutional erosion in the US, people's support for democracy-eroding political leaders is receiving much overdue attention. But existing studies have a difficulty disentangling contextual effects (such as who is in power at the time of the survey) from individual differences (like which party one supports and how much). We propose a novel survey experimental design to strip away the political context through hypothetical scenarios. This allows us to gauge the public’s democratic hypocrisy: how much a citizen’s approval of eroding democratic norms and institutions depends on how much one likes the party in power. Findings suggest that while Republicans are more approving of policies that erode democratic norms and institutions no matter which party is in power at a given time, both Democrats and Republicans engage in democratic hypocrisy, supporting a change in democratic practices when it will enhance their party’s advantage. The magnitude of that effect is stronger for individuals with stronger partisan attachment. The findings are clearly alarming.

Based on the literatures on populism and social movements, this paper looks at the first mass pro-government mobilization in Turkey, namely the Respect the National Will rallies organized in the summer of 2013. To understand how these rallies contributed to democratic backsliding in the country, the article uses critical discourse analysis. Four discursive mechanisms were identified in play in Turkey during these rallies: nomination, predication, argumentation and intensification. The article argues that the rallies were countermobilizations organized by the ruling party, and this mobilization and the discourse mechanisms used further contributed to democratic backsliding in the country by delegitimizing anti-government protests and protestors, shrinking the democratic space for opposition and opening the path for increased levels of pro-government mobilization.", :year 2021, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "Turkish Studies", :pages "407 - 429", :volume "23"}, :authors [{:authorId "108592649", :name "Selin Gümrükçü"}]} {:paperId "3b557580ea62937bb1ff9ded66ca7e2b3c582ac1", :title "The EU cannot afford to just ‘muddle through’ on Turkey.

Hill’s Review of Democracy’s Meaning: How the Public Understands Democracy and Why It Matters", :abstract "norms, their evaluation of democracy in any setting is necessarily more precarious than the evaluation of a proceduralist holding more minimal criteria. A second front of concern is that the opinion survey asks respondents to rate each characteristic of democracy on its own, rather than in relationship with other goals for the respondent. Voters might say that free and fair elections or freedom of association is essential to democracy in the abstract, but when application of those values leads to political results contrary to other values they hold, they must compromise on one of the two. Connecting to my work under review in this Critical Dialogue, if voters care more intensely about the political result than about the democratic norm, their action might follow politics rather than norms. Indeed, one might even define democratic backsliding as a change in relative intensity for political outcomes versus democratic norms. Americans might continue to endorse free speech and fair elections as before, but if their perception is that the policy consequences of elections are of greater salience—as might be the case with increased polarization between the party coalitions— voter willingness to swallow political defeat in deference to democracy might decline. Despite the rhetoric of “Stop the Steal” around election fraud, my suspicion is that many who entered the Capitol on January 6, 2021 did so more to prevent what they saw as an unacceptable Biden presidency than to prevent certification of a stolen election. More broadly, if readers adopted the perspective on public opinion presented in John Zaller’s 1992 book, The Nature and Origins of Mass Opinion, they might be concerned about the empirical enterprise of Democracy’s Meanings. Many Americans have not thought carefully about what features they deem essential to a democratic system. Their opinion survey responses might simply reflect “what they’ve heard” from the elite political rhetoric in their information milieu. Proceduralists might give responses reflecting the rhetoric they hear about the rule of law and fair elections, and indeed the authors find proceduralists more likely identify as conservative and Republican. Maximalists might give responses reflecting the rhetoric they hear about inequality and disenfranchisement, and indeed the authors find that maximalists more likely identify as liberal and Democratic. Under this Zaller-type story, the relevant influence on meanings of democracy would be elite rhetoric, rather than individual opinion. Democratic backsliding would follow, then, from a change in the elite rhetoric surrounding norms of democracy. My sense is that there is ample evidence of this phenomenon taking place. Research documenting and quantifying this trend so we can better understand its causes and evaluate its effect on individual citizens strikes me as a natural and important part of the project started in this book. If elite rhetoric drives public opinion on the meaning of democracy, it does imply a potential problem of accountability, as the authors suggest. Political elites who defy norms of democracy might use rhetoric to influence the public’s definition, upend the evaluative criteria that might have been held against them, and proceed with their action without risk of voter retribution. It is crucial to understand whether voters hold ethical standards for democratic conduct external to elite rhetoric. The authors, on my read, accept the premise that the United States is experiencing democratic backsliding and argue that public opinion is part of the story: “We are struck by the democratic deficit that faces the United States. Americans are socially divided, and yet, they share a set of expectations for good governance that are woefully unfulfilled” (p. xiii). I am not certain why they make this claim. Although it is true that the authors classify 40% of American opinion as maximalist, 50% is either proceduralist or moderate. Therefore, we should not expect that the maximalist position should gain full representation in public policy. We might instead expect some kind of weighted average, which I would suggest is roughly what we have. The American state enacts massive redistribution that counteracts some, though not all, of the recent increase in income inequality. The Congressional Budget Office, for example, estimates that federal taxes and means-tested transfers increase income for households in the lowest quintile by 64% and decrease incomes in the highest quintile by 24% (“The Distribution of Household Income, 2019,” Washington, DC, Exhibit S-1). This is not to say that the extent of federal efforts toward economic equality matches the perceptions of many Americans about what the American democracy should be doing, only to push back on claims that the effort is demonstrably inadequate.

Despite the real consequences of support for violence, fairly little is known about such an extremist attitude outside studies of terrorism or aggression. Using a unique survey containing many psychological, political, and social characteristics, we find that perceived victimhood, authoritarianism, populism, and white identity are the most powerful predictors of support for violence, though military service, conspiratorial thinking, anxiety, and feelings of powerlessness are also related. These patterns suggest that subjective feelings about being unjustly victimized—irrespective of the truth of the matter—and the psychological baggage that accompanies such feelings lie at the heart of support for violence. We use these results to build a profile of characteristics that explain support for violence; the predictive validity of this profile is then tested by examining its relationship with support for the January 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot, with which it is strongly associated, even accounting for support for Donald Trump.

It insightfully demonstrates that major global changes were spawned by the collapse of the Soviet Bloc and the advent of new information technologies. The new technologies and political trends have paved the way for the establishment of a new system of global production, transportation, trade, communication, financial speculation and manipulative repressive practices that erode the avenues open to ordinary citizens. Subsequent redefinition of capitalism in a transnational and global framework installed a new era and new schisms that we are still coming to terms with.This publication soundly illustrates that Jerry Harris, National Secretary of the Global Studies Association of North America, is one of the leading authors of a critical analysis of global capitalism. At the same time, focusing on the crisis of democracy, the book heralds a potential solution to this crisis.From the perspective of the author, the book extends his previous work The Dialectics of Globalization: Economic and Political Struggle in a Transnational Era (Harris 2008), presenting a comprehensive analysis of the global system and transnational capitalist class.When it comes to collective research, the book makes an important contribution to the \"critical school of global capitalism\", i.e., a transnational group of researchers who specialise in this topic and have been brought together in the Network for Critical Studies of Global Capitalism. This is no coincidental contribution because Harris is a member of the Network's International Executive Board. He shares with William Robinson, Leslie Sklair, Georgina Murray, David Peetz and several others, as key analysts of the topic, the analytical baselines of the school; at the same time, he pursues his own original path, with an emphasis on the democratic deficit and on identifying specific ways out of the crisis through the potential revitalisation of democracy.The book is worth a thorough read. It can be split into three parts, though the author does not explicitly do so. The first part could be said to comprise the initial three chapters. While the first two chapters present an analysis of the current decline of democracy and the class contradictions of market fundamentalism in the system of global capitalism, the third chapter outlines a potential compromise in the form of the Green New Deal. The second part is made up by the fourth and fifth chapters, which widen the discussion further beyond the USA and illustrate the various contradictions within a broader framework. There are case studies dwelling on the military and political conflict in Ukraine, and on China's specific situation in terms of the domestic and transnational landscapes. The third, final part of the book is its sixth and seventh chapters. They start by examining failed alternatives of state socialism in the Soviet Bloc and futile, muted anarchistic attempts to change the system's sub-components. The book as a whole is aimed at real and theoretical alternatives.The book's central idea is an analysis of the three elements: the state, market, and civil society. Harris demonstrates that different types of economic and political systems in both the past and the present have maintained a reductionist focus on just one of these elements. First, the Soviet Union tried to create a socialist society rooted in state power, which became more and more bureaucratic. State power consequently hypertrophied, eclipsing the market and civil society. Second, anarchistic attempts at a non-hierarchical society relied on a set of relationships within civil society, with the market and the state pushed into the background or eliminated completely. The absence of larger-scale state-backed organisation ultimately means anarchistic attempts will founder in a complex society. …", :year 2017, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes ["Review"], :journal {:name "World Review of Political Economy", :pages "123", :volume "8"}, :authors [{:authorId "71435214", :name "Marek Hrubec"}]} {:paperId "3c95f98b03560f36921224e1afdbf2ed1221f51b", :title "Changes in support for Nicaragua’s Sandinista National Liberation Front during democratic backsliding", :abstract "This article examines changes in the determinants of support for Nicaragua’s Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN), a party that has achieved dominant status during democratic backsliding.

It has long been well known that the military is a key actor in Thai politics. The two most recent military coups, in September 2006 and May 2014, added to the long list of military coups that Thailand has seen since the end of the absolute monarchy era in 1932. Before 2006, however, there was a 15-year period during which the military was virtually absent from politics and electoral democracy appeared to take hold. As successive civilian governments won and lost power in parliamentary elections rather than through non-electoral means, Thailand at the time was evidently heading towards democratic consolidation, cementing its place as part of the global ‘Third Wave’ of countries adopting democracy and rejecting authoritarian rule. The 2006 coup was thus a sudden and largely unexpected event, putting a stop to the previous democratic trajectory while marking a return of the military to forefront of the domestic political scene. \n \nDrawing on first-hand empirical data, the thesis looks at how the military has manipulated politics and contributed to the weakening of Thailand’s democratic prospects.

Why has neoliberalism remained so resilient? What is the relationship between this resiliency and the backsliding of Western democracy?

This book answers these questions by bringing the developing world's recent history to the forefront of our thinking about democratic capitalism's future. Looking at four decades of change in four countries once considered to be leading examples of effective neoliberal policy in Latin America and Eastern Europe — Argentina, Chile, Estonia, and Poland — the book examines the domestic actors and institutions responsible for defending neoliberalism. Delving into neoliberalism's political power, the book demonstrates that it is strongest in countries where traditional democratic principles have been slowly and purposefully weakened. It identifies three mechanisms through which coalitions of political, institutional, and financial forces have propagated neoliberalism's success: the privatization of state companies to create a supporting business class, the use of political institutions to block the representation of alternatives in congress, and the constitutionalization of key economic policies to shield them from partisan influence.

Recent trends in the political life of these countries provide a meaningful lens for reflection on the relevance of political science for civil society and democratic policymaking. These trends further recognize the diverse “ways in which the political world contributes to, and detracts from, our efforts to flourish as individuals and communities” in a region where the discipline of political science has traveled a shifting path from state subordination to rediscovery within an increasingly integrated, internationalized educational system (Schmidt 2019). Arguably, there are important trends and unique challenges for political science scholars and teachers in CEE relative to their counterparts in North America andWestern Europe. Our goal for this Spotlight is to highlight these issues. CEE countries have been the site of many transformations, including from authoritarianism to democracy, from planned to market economies, and from former communist bloc to European Union (EU) member states. Recent trends showing a decline in democracy and the emergence of right-wing nationalist governments in Hungary and Poland are troublesome, however. As pointed out by Rafał Szymanowski in this Spotlight, “democratic backsliding in the region, like asymmetric benefits of systemic transition, rising economic inequalities, nationalist sentiments, and growing sympathy for the authoritarian rule” are powerful undercurrents in CEE countries. Democratic backsliding as well as historical legacies, underinvestment, and the impact of communist rule on higher education present challenges to political science and the social sciences more broadly. After the 1990 political and economic transition,2 higher education in CEE underwent rapid changes, divided into two distinct periods. The first period (1990s–2000s) was characterized by an increasing popularity of social science and growing student enrollment in fields such as political science, international relations, economics, and law. These fields became especially popular because they required little additional infrastructure or investment (Dobbins and Kwiek 2017). However, faculty appeared ill prepared to meet the growing demands for teaching and research. Before 1989, social scientists—unlike their peers in mathematics and the physical sciences—were permitted limited travel and access to non-Marxist political science. Whereas other scholars studied abroad, these professionals remained behind the Iron Curtain, largely unaware of theories and methods emerging in the West (Meredith and Steele 2014). The second period in the evolution of higher education in CEE (early 2000s–present) is marked by decreasing enrollment in the social sciences due to declining demographics and increasing access to EU and international programs. Most notable are the Bologna process, which aims to make European higher education systems more coherent and accessible; and the European Higher Education Area, which is a collaboration among 49 countries for implementing structural reforms around common values including academic freedom, institutional autonomy, and free movement of students and staff (European Commission 2021; European Higher Education Area 2021). These processes provide the backdrop for understanding higher education reforms and the impetus for efforts to internationalize political science teaching and learning in CEE. Our goal for this Spotlight is to explore ways in which political science research and teaching is practiced in CEE countries, considering national and regional trends; processes of internationalization, standardization, and competitiveness; and other issues vital to the region.

Countries rarely end up with worse democratic credentials because of democracy protests. Second, the most successful protests – that is, where governments make concessions – tend to be very large affairs. As it happens, the size of the protest is itself directly related to the severity of economic crises: deeper crises increase both the likelihood of democracy protests and their size. A rich picture starts to emerge of how a small number of key variables can precipitate (successful) democracy protests. The results of the analysis lead Brancati to question some of the field’s big ideas: modernisation theory, in particular, is challenged at several points in the book. Crudely stated, this theory identifies economic development as a driver of democratisation, and points to the strong historical correlation between economic development and democracy. Democracy Protests seems to be at odds with this theory. Brancati highlights that, other things being equal, economic crises (especially near elections) are more likely to generate democracy protests in poor autocratic countries than rich autocratic ones. This is, undoubtedly, an important finding, but its implications are underexplored in the book’s conclusion. Specifically, how do the causes and results of democracy protests interact with democratic consolidation? True, in Chapter 8, Democracy Protests provides evidence that the results of successful protests tend to endure, but the analysis is restricted to a few years after the fact. Brancati may have sound methodological reasons for doing so – as time passes, new variables will emerge that make it difficult to know the precise impact of the original protests – but the question of long-term consolidation is worth raising, if only to help readers understand how her research dovetails with the wider literature. While definitive answers to such questions are likely beyond the book’s scope, some exploration would have been welcomed and contributed to setting a broader agenda. Overall, the book’s considered analysis deepens our understanding of what drives democratisation. In the current global context of stalling democratisation, both scholars and policymakers need a solid grasp of how democracy develops. This requires the sort of meticulously detailed work that rests on strongly supported findings, together with a measured scepticism towards ingrained assumptions, that Brancati demonstrates. As this book makes clear, there is so much more to learn. n", :year 2022, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "The RUSI Journal", :pages "99 - 101", :volume "167"}, :authors [{:authorId "73142470", :name "D.

Unlike sudden democratic collapse, erosion proceeds slowly in a series of small steps. What, if anything, should courts do about the risk of democratic erosion? Do courts have any role in preventing democratic backsliding? This Article answers in the affirmative and provides numerous examples of courts that helped to prevent democratic erosion at particular points in recent history. Courts are particularly important because the threats to constitutional democracy today tend to take a legal form. Authoritarians have learned to use the law and to leverage the rule-of-law discourse that has spread around the world in recent decades. Law, then, is not a neutral technology but takes its life and direction from the broader political environment. Drawing on a framework I previously developed with Professor Huq, this Article examines what steps courts can take to limit various modalities of democratic erosion. This Article recognizes that courts are unlikely to be sufficient to accomplish this task on their own, but they can contribute to a broader institutional structure that can prevent democratic backsliding.

We develop an agency-based perspective to enhance the understanding of aggrandizement and to explain when it results in democratic breakdown. Relying on comparative case studies of five countries—Bolivia, Ecuador, Thailand, Turkey, and Venezuela—our analysis suggests that the contingent decisions of opposition actors during the process of aggrandizement have a significant effect on regime outcomes. Irregular opposition attempts to remove incumbents from office, which are especially likely after electoral defeats, contribute to democratic breakdown.

The theoretical foundation for expecting peace to flow from democracy was set forth by Immanuel Kant. According to the interpretation in this article, Kant's notion of a pacific union of democracies rests on three pillars; first, the mere existence of democracies with their culture of peaceful resolution of conflict; second, the common moral bonds which are forged between democracies on this basis; third, the democracies' economic cooperation towards mutual advantage. The paper analyses each of the three conditions in the light of recent processes of democratization. It concludes that the emergence of a global pacific union embracing all the new and old democracries cannot be taken for granted. Success for the pacific union demands that the three basic conditions laid down by Kant are met by all members. Presently, this is far from the case. A pacific union is a reality among the industrialized democracies in the West; it may expand to include several of the new democracies in the East. Yet most of the democracies in the South fail to meet at least two of Kant's conditions, and instead of further democratic progress, they may backslide towards authoritarian rule. Finally, the article argues that it is possible to accept Kant's vision without rejecting basic insights of neorealism. The distance between Kant's idealism and neorealism is often overdone, as in Mearsheimer's analysis. A pacific union is the type of anarchy called a security community. It is only the extreme vision of Mearsheimerian neorealism with its one-sided emphasis on raw anarchy, and patterns of alliance and threat between anonymous state-units as the only sources of peace and war, which creates an insurmountable gulf between neorealism and Kantian thinking.", :year 1992, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "Journal of Peace Research", :pages "397-414", :volume "29"}, :authors [{:authorId "94355455", :name "Georg Sørensen"}]} {:paperId "40d32ff4834b2ef23ef9aa03929fcc7f187ebac2", :title "A Generation of Reform ... and a Few Years of Backsliding", :abstract "Australian economic policy and performance over the past generation cannot be understood without a little historical background.

Autocratisation resulted from the deliberate use of legal mechanisms to enhance executive power. Tracing key legal changes through legal documents, press reports and informant interviews, the article examines this recent episode of autocratisation as a consequence of a poorly institutionalised party system in a fledgling and unconsolidated presidential democracy. We show that under PF rule, autocratisation resulted from the deliberate use of legal mechanisms to enhance executive power, stifle the opposition, muzzle the press and undermine civil society forces. The election of opposition candidate Hakainde Hichilema in August 2021 may have ended this episode of backsliding as for the third time in the country´s history, power changed peacefully through the ballot box. But, to what extent the 2021 elections will move Zambia away from this authoritarian trend is uncertain as the state of the country’s political institutions, hereunder a poorly institutionalised party system in an unconsolidated presidential democracy, may leave it vulnerable to further episodes of backsliding.

(Democracy)", :abstract "In December 1991, the Soviet Union ceased to exist. In its place, a newly independent Russian democracy was born, alongside 14 other republics. The 10th anniversary of that momentous event provides a fitting occasion to pause and take stock, to consider how much has been accomplished and how much remains to be done. It is also an opportunity for advocates and students of democratization to reflect on the Russian case, as well as other cases across the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. It is an opportunity to reassess our conceptualization of Western-assisted democratization. This essay provides a sketch of a new conceptual framework for analyzing democratization in terms of institutional developments. Against that backdrop, I offer a brief assessment of Russia's democratic development over the past decade. Although the last decades of the 20th century witnessed a fast march to democracy in Eastern and Central Europe, they also revealed powerful tendencies toward greater central authority in the countries of the former Soviet Union, including Russia. This dynamic is apparent in leaders who believe they are undertaking great tasks in rebuilding and modernizing their countries and who seek to mobilize cooperation and support, not criticism and dissent. Public demands for both order and a higher standard of living create an environment that allows for backsliding toward centralized authority and even authoritarianism. It is no accident that such ideas resonate with leaders whose formative political experiences occurred in communist party structures. Despite romantic enthusiasm and expectations to the contrary, democratization is neither linear nor quick. Consolidation of democracy occurs across several dimensions both in the economy and in the society. The process advances in fits and starts. The path of democratization resembles stairs; each step forward provides a foundation from which a state can move forward or slide back. Once some steps toward democracy are taken, it becomes much harder to reverse the process. Therefore, in striving to deepen democracy in transitional states, the primary challenge is to think strategically about the types of institutions, sources of power, and forms of behavior that can work to encourage early democratic steps and secure them against countervailing pressure. These institutional and behavioral pillars constitute, in effect, barriers against backsliding into authoritarianism. Barriers to Backsliding We need a working definition of democracy. While Robert Dahl and others have taught us how complex a concept democracy is, for this article's purpose we will take Joseph Schumpeter's definition of democracy as our starting point. Democracy is a political system that provides for (1) meaningful and extensive competition among individuals and organized groups (especially political parties) for all effective positions of government power at regular intervals, excluding the use of force; (2) a \"highly inclusive\" level of political participation in the selection of leaders and policies, at least through regular and fair elections, so that no major social group is excluded; and (3) a level of civil and political liberties--freedom of expression, freedom of the press, freedom of association--sufficient to ensure the integrity of political competition and participation. Democracies survive because of social forces that can withstand inevitable pressures toward backsliding. One of the most significant institutional pillars of democracy is the pluralization of economic power, meaning that centers of economic power are independent of the state. The more pluralistic the ownership of sources of finance and what Karl Marx called the \"means of production in a country, the more widely power is dispersed. Economic pluralization provides substructure\" for political democratization. The middle class operates in much the same way. …", :year 2002, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "Harvard international review", :pages "62", :volume "24"}, :authors [{:authorId "144859767", :name "G.

Recent research suggests that inaccurate and exaggerated meta-perceptions about opposing partisans’ willingness to subvert democratic norms significantly shape the individual’s own willingness to do so (Pasek et al. 2022; Braley et al. 2022; Lees and Cikara 2020; Moore-Berg et al. 2020). Partisans tend to overestimate the other side’s willingness to break democratic rules and norms, which in turn increases their own readiness to break such norms. Recent experimental work shows that correcting these inaccurate and exaggerated meta-perceptions improves the individual’s commitment to democratic rules and norms (e.g, Braley et al. 2022). Despite the importance of citizens’ support for and commitment to democratic norms, we still know relatively little about the role of meta-perceptions in democratic backsliding. Existing work has focused on meta-perceptions about opposing partisans. In this project, however, our core theoretical argument is that partisans’ commitment to democratic norms is more sensitive to perceptions of in-group members than of out-group members. That is, we expect that perceptions of adherence to democratic norms by co-partisans are a stronger determinant of the individual’s own commitment to or subversion of these norms than perceptions of adherence by opposing partisans. Understanding the impact of in-group meta-perceptions for citizens’ commitment to democracy is important for several reasons. First, recent work suggests that positive partisanship (in-party affinity) is more influential than negative partisanship (out-party animus/apathy) (Lee et al. 2022; Yu et al. 2023). Hence, there are reasons to expect that the individual’s perception of how other co-partisans think and feel about democracy may be a particularly important determinant of their own democratic values. Moreover, citizens are often exposed to information about their in-group, whether through news, online, or by socialization. Many recent polls, for example, have exposed Republican partisans to information about undemocratic sentiments held by a majority of their ingroup members (e.g., Pew 2022). Does information about the share of Republicans accepting an election loss, for example, shape the individual Republican’s commitment to democratic norms? And is information about other Republicans more influential than information about Democratic partisans? We propose to examine our argument in a survey experiment with 2,000 respondents set in the United States. The experiment assigns factual information from the Polarization Research Lab’s (2022) surveys about partisans’ willingness to break democratic norms. We then estimate the effects of correcting either inor out-party perceptions on willingness to violate democratic norms (see proposed study design). Finally, we examine the expectation that this effect is particularly pronounced among individuals who express a higher desire for belonging to their in-party. The proposed project makes important contributions to our understanding of the drivers of undemocratic sentiments among ordinary voters and partisans, adding to the growing literature on democratic backsliding more broadly. Specifically, we contribute by examining how in-group metaperceptions may influence the individual’s commitment to the rules, principles, and norms of liberal democracy. Whereas previous work has examined the potentially detrimental effects of inaccurate perceptions about out-partisans, we highlight a novel explanation (meta-perceptions of co-partisans) and demonstrate the importance of conformity in shaping people’s commitment to democracy.", :year 2023, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes ["Review"], :journal nil, :authors []} {:paperId "429240053f3100be47d5f37c9fb45205641c041b", :title "Constitutional Inertia and Regime Pluralism in Asia", :abstract "Many fear that constitutional democracy is under threat from democratic backlash and losing ground to illiberal constitutionalism.

Comparison of such jurisdictions as South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong, China, and Thailand is sufficient to cast doubt on (1) but suggests that (2) and (3) are both plausible.

To bring culture back in, this article demonstrates that 1) countries' membership in culture zones explains some 70 percent of the total cross-national variation in autocracy-versus-democracy; and 2) this culture-bound variation has remained astoundingly constant over time—in spite of all the trending patterns in the global distribution of regime types over the last 120 years. Furthermore, the explanatory power of culture zones over autocracy-versus-democracy is rooted in the cultures' differentiation on \"authoritarian-versus-emancipative values.\" Therefore, both the direction and the extent of regime change are a function of glacially accruing regime-culture misfits—driven by generational value shifts in a predominantly emancipatory direction. Consequently, the backsliding of democracies into authoritarianism is limited to societies in which emancipative values remain underdeveloped.

However, the question of whether rulers’ personalist rhetoric to bolster their legitimacy is followed by congruent political action remains underspecified. Using new expert-coded measures for 164 countries from the Varieties of Democracy project, we examine the political rhetoric–action link using using fixed effects models. The results confirm that shifts towards personalist legitimacy claims are no cheap talk but oftentimes important warning signals for a substantial deterioration of democratic quality, manifested in weaker judicial and legislative oversight of the executive branch.

Over the course of the last three decades, however, drug-trafficking, organised crime and high levels of violence and insecurity have deeply transformed this historical pattern with Mexico experiencing a clearcut process of militarization and becoming part of a broad Latin American trend. This article investigates the forces behind and the features of the remarkable political and ideological turnaround with respect to Mexico’s military and militarization. To provide proper context, it first examines the evolution of civil-military relations in Mexico during the era of PRI dominance (ca. 1945-ca. 1985) and the subsequent challenges of a democratic recasting of civil-military relations. It then studies how from the 1990s onwards drug trafficking (and its mutation into organised crime) and an escalating security crisis affected civil-military relations. The last section critically examines the unprecedented promotion of military roles and prerogatives during the administration of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador (2018-2024). The conclusion argues that the shifting relations between civilians and soldiers in Mexico are likely to weaken civilian control over the military and hence risk democratic backsliding.", :year 2023, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes ["JournalArticle"], :journal {:name "Alternatives: Global, Local, Political"}, :authors [{:authorId "5377642", :name "W.

The election resulted in Zambia’s third alternation of power between political parties since the democratic wave of the 1990s. The ruling Patriotic Front (PF) used its incumbent advantages to control institutions that were crucial for promoting democracy and ensuring a credible election. The election was also characterised by political violence which limited the ability for the opposition United Party for National Development (UPND) to mobilise freely. Further, an Afrobarometer survey conducted in December 2020 showed that half of all citizens surveyed were unwilling to declare who they would vote for, thereby suppressing the extent of UPND’s support. Yet, the UPND won 59% in the presidential election and won the most parliamentary seats in an election that had one of the highest voter-turnouts since the advent of Zambia’s multi-party democracy.

This emerging body of law, contrary to its origins, appears to fortify a state-sanctioned victimhood and seeks to establish a preferable narrative of history in public memory through legal means. The outlook on WWII history and the dominance of Soviet communism is a central point of contestation as CEE states construct opposing historical narratives that implicate one another in the ongoing war for remembrance. In our contribution, we focus on three CEE states as country studies, covering memory laws in Poland, Russia, and Ukraine, as well as analyzing their memory legislation in the context of memory wars. Our analysis subsequently highlights how ‘memory wars’ unfold as proxy wars for contemporary state identities. A quest for mnemonical security, states securitize the governance of memory which is hence excluded from public discourse and subjugated to restrictive permissible discourses and remembrance practices. These methods of mnemonic governance via militant memory laws thereby erode the foundational elements of liberal democracy, weaken constitutional orders as well as add fuel to nationalist tendencies, all of which have implications for democratic backsliding. Furthermore, our contribution demonstrates that memory laws in all three countries have been adopted as swords and shields amidst the mutual memory wars: (1) between Poland and Ukraine, on the one side, against Russia, on the other side, as well as (2) Poland and Ukraine between themselves, and (3) Russia and Ukraine between themselves.

We consider human rights violations and domestic and global inequities that have characterised COVID-19 and COVID responses. Findings and conclusions: The pandemic has illustrated how rights-violating, negligent, and inequitable political leadership can deeply determine health outcomes.

This debate is especially acute in Southeast Asia, where many recently democratized states appear to be back-sliding into authoritarianism and embracing illiberal values. In Indonesia, this can be observed in the increasingly influential role played by hard-line Islamic groups in shaping state policy, and concessions made by politicians to such groups, such as proposed anti-LGBT legislation. The state has also begun to encroach on the public sphere in worrying ways. While this does pose some fears about the future of liberal values in the country, this article argues that it is not an unexpected turn of events in a socially conservative country with under-developed institutions and weak rule of law that is working through the challenges of economic and political development. Rather, placing democratization on a pedestal and viewing it as a cure-all back in the 1990s created unrealistic expectations for what democracy was and what it could do. It minimized the complex, nuanced nature of how young democracies would actually struggle to balance the interests of a wide range of social actors, or that the beliefs and values underpinning democratic systems might change over time. What we are witnessing in Indonesia, and in the larger regional and global context, is thus not the death of democracy but the messy guts of the democratic process in action. Introduction Indonesia has often been viewed as a democratizing success story, with the New York Times calling it a “role model for democracy” in 20141 and Freedom House conferring it the status of “Free” in 2006.2 1 Cochrane, Joe. 2014. “In Southeast Asia, Indonesia Is an Unlikely Role Model for Democracy.” New York Times, September 4. 2 Freedom House, 2006 Country Report (Indonesia). Can be accessed here. https://freedomhouse.org/report/ freedom-world/2006/indonesia. While Freedom House’s rating system for press freedoms and civil liberties is not infallible, it serves as a good barometer for where the general consensus on how free and open a country is. THE CREEPING HAND OF THE STATE Some observers, however, have recently begun to wonder if the country is backsliding into authoritarian tendencies, while its political class indulges in divisive identity politics. In support of this they cite recent legislation designed to criminalize homosexuality, the jailing of Jakarta’s former governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama (commonly known as Ahok) on blasphemy charges, and the increasingly important role conservative Islamist movements are playing in shaping state policy. The rise of illiberal social forces, coupled with an expansion of state power is especially problematic in young democracies like Indonesia, which often have under 3 developed institutions, inefficient civil services, and weak rule of law. This combination of structural weaknesses exposes developing democracies to the influence of illiberal populist movements and opportunistic demagogues with authoritarian tendencies. Elements of this process are clearly underway not only in Indonesia, but in the Philippines, the United States, Brazil and Hungary to name just a few examples. Some have even wondered if this marks an irreversible democratic decline in the world.4 This article argues that current trends in Indonesia do not represent the death of democracy, although they may indicate a repudiation of liberal, Westernstyle democracy. Democratization has often been thought of as uni-linear and intrinsically good, when in practice it is JAMES GUILD much more nuanced and complex. In the past several decades, the literature on democratization has sought to portray it as a self-evidently desirable normative ideal toward which societies should strive by embracing liberal values and enshrining them in a free and open representative political system. The primary failing of this approach is that it does not account for the fact that democracy simply promises to give the people a voice. It does not promise that the voice they choose will reflect Western ideas of universal values, or that those values will remain static. The creeping illiberalism and expansion of the state’s coercive power in Indonesia is not conclusive evidence that democracy there has entered an irreversible decline – in fact, this is not an unexpected example of what the democratic process would be expected to look like in a socially conservative state that is still working to develop its democratic institutions and locate a workable balance between individual freedoms and state control. In the Indonesian context, democracy is a far-cry from the normative, liberal ideal that has formed the basis of much writing and debate on the subject in the past. It has instead assumed the form of a messy and often contradictory process by which a diverse set of stakeholders compete with one another to advance their agendas, interests and values. 3 For a recent example of this back-sliding see Power, Tom. 2018. “Jokowi’s Authoritarian Turn.” New Mandala, October 9. 4 Rose, Gideon. 2018. “Is Democracy Dying?” Foreign Affairs. May/June. One consequence of this process is that conservative elements of society with 6 Explorations Volume 15, 2019 THE CREEPING HAND OF THE STATE illiberal beliefs and values are finding success in influencing the direction of state policy through democratic mechanisms. The process is also demonstrating that a democratic society may be willing to allow the state to infringe on certain liberties and freedoms in exchange for the promise of stability. This does not mean that democracy is failing but that the system of governance it produces is more dynamic, and more context-driven than is sometimes acknowledged. Indonesia’s ongoing efforts to walk the tight-rope of democratization highlights some of the challenges that young democracies struggle with and helps explain why democracy in the country is not conforming to the ideal version that some observers once expected. This analysis begins with a broad discussion of the literature on democratization in the post-Cold War period, and how that literature has struggled to reconcile itself with a global democratic recession. It will then move to a discussion of democratization in Southeast Asia, with special attention paid to the way in which the idea of “Asian Values” informed the debate prior to the Asian Financial Crisis, before moving onto an evaluation of how democracy has fared in the region. Having established this context and background, the paper will then narrow its focus to a detailed case study of Indonesia’s democratization, with particular attention paid to the process by which different stakeholders are competing in the democratic space to work JAMES GUILD out a balance of power that reflects underlying social and political conflicts, and why this process may appear like a democratic retreat or authoritarian regression even if that is not necessarily so. Democratization in a Post-Cold War World With the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, it appeared self-evident to some scholars that there was no longer any serious challenger to the dominance of a liberal democratic system of governance. It was in this year that Samuel Huntington published The Third Wave: Democratization in the Late Twentieth Century in which he noted that, after Portugal became a democracy in 1974, the world experienced a “wave” of authoritarian regimes giving way to democratic systems of government in Africa, Latin America, Europe and Asia. 5Francis Fukuyama famously wondered if we had reached “the end point of mankind’s ideological evolution and the universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government.”6 5 Huntington, Samuel. 1991. The Third Wave: Democratization in the Late Twentieth Century. Oklahoma: University of Oklahoma Press. 6 Fukuyama, Francis. Summer 1989. “The End of History?” The National Interest. It has been over two decades since this fervor for democratization began to reach its apex, and the optimistic mood of the 1990s has soured somewhat since then. It has been noted that many of the regimes that transitioned to democracy during the “third wave” did so only superficially, and soon reverted back to a kind of semiauthoritarianism cloaked in rhetorical appeals to democratic ideals. The United 7 Explorations Volume 15, 2019 THE CREEPING HAND OF THE STATE JAMES GUILD States’ attempt to bring democracy through force to Iraq was an unmitigated disaster and with the election of Donald Trump, many think pieces and books have recently appeared wondering if perhaps the liberal democratic order is dead.7 Foreign Affairs devoted an entire recent issue to the question of what the liberal order was and whether or not we are losing it.8 Larry Diamond, the editor of the Journal of Democracy, the establishment of which in 1990 reflected prevailing beliefs in the inertia of democratic progress, recently published an article entitled “Facing Up to the Democratic Recession” in which he acknowledged that many of the early assumptions about the forces of democratization were incomplete and overly optimistic.9 While still maintaining that democracy as an ideal is superior to all others, Diamond admits that many democratic states that transitioned during the third wave remain illiberal and unstable. Fukuyama has likewise modified his earlier optimism, writing that democracy as a normative ideal alone is not sufficient to sustain the transition to a functional democratic political system.10 Equally, if not more important, is the quality and design of that system. Transitioning to democracy without strong institutions can actually weaken the quality of governance, an observation with high explanatory power when used to make sense of the global democratic recession that is underway.

There may be many causes for democratic collapse, but many observers agree that poor economic performance and unequal distribution of wealth have provided the impetus for tyranny, authoritarianism on the one hand and provoked popular democratic struggles on the other hand. However, the nature of the political system has had different impacts on political stability.

The situation has become particularly worrying in the last year, as the ‘constitutional backslidings’ or ‘constitutional crises’, included a shining example of the ‘new’ European nations, one rated as first-in-class for economic progress and democratic stability, namely Poland. Of these constitutional crises and the threat they pose to the preservation of European values much has been written. Opinions more or less agree in acknowledging a regression of democratic and constitutional culture in the new EU Member States owing mainly to the absence of constitutional traditions and the haste of their admission into the Union. A broader classification also includes Italy and Greece because of the general inefficiency of public administration, the high rate of corruption, the slow pace of justice, the pervasiveness of organized crime, or, as in the case of France, regarding the treatment of Roma (in 2010). The first concerns about the compliance with democratic values within the EU arose, as is well known, in connection with the electoral success of a far-right party in Austria in the 1999 parliamentary elections. In this case, as for Italy, France and Greece, concerns have faded away because of electoral turnover, or the shelving of the more controversial projects. However, the question remains unresolved for Hungary and Poland. The most serious ‘constitutional crises’ among the new EU Member States are in fact those of Hungary and Poland. There is also the case of Romania which however is treated, depending on the commentator, as further proof of the weakness of the rule of law in the country or as an example of successful post-access compliance, given the ‘happy’ resolution of the confrontation between the Government, the President and the Constitutional Court in the crisis during the summer of 2012 (concluded with a political solution in an institutional context forever at risk of permanent stalemate).

Drawing on existing literature, this study elaborates on the various channels, direct and indirect, through which development and democracy aid has influenced transitions to multi-party regimes and democratic consolidation within the region. The study´s findings are at least threefold. First, development aid was effective at promoting democratic transitions during the 1990s in those African countries that were beset by economic crisis, faced domestic discontent, or possessed a high dependence on aid, as well as when major donors took concerted action. Second, development and democracy aid demonstrate disparate effects on key elements of consolidation, including the avoidance of democratic erosion, the enhancement of accountability, and the promotion of competitive party systems. Development aid´s most direct influence is with respect to preventing democratic backsliding, though this is often done in an inconsistent manner. Democracy aid plays a more direct role with respect to enhancing accountability and party systems but, its cumulative impact remains hindered by the dispersion of assistance across different activities and its temporal focus on elections. Third, in some areas of consolidation, the disparate objectives of development and democracy aid create clear trade-offs that remain unresolved.", :year 2012, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "", :volume ""}, :authors [{:authorId "40462418", :name "D.

This paper defines the phenomenon under examination as revolutionary to employ a general theoretical framework through which de-democratization may be analyzed and proactively addressed: (1) strain, an opportunity structure, an authorizing belief, and precipitating factors constitute the necessary and sufficient conditions for the genesis of intra-state revolutionary activity; (2) an authorizing social movement elects a candidate who then affects a revolution from within along a developmental progression from a redefinition of executive powers, to a reorganization of the political collectivity, then a redefinition of institutionalized norms, and finally a total revolution of the base values that enable a radically different authority structure; (3) the sustainability of the anti-democratic movement is determined by its ability to garner legitimation from the societal community by a set of subterranean values, justification through patrimonial allegiances within a formal bureaucracy, and surplus product from the economy. This scheme is applied to the contemporary United States, where it is argued the 2016 election of Donald Trump and his activity in office manifest latent protofascist conditions in the first stages of what might become a more radical revolution within the state.

The present era is the time where democratic backsliding and covert autocratization have become the prevalent issues. Some regimes dress their activities under the guise of a liberal and democratic discourse. In lieu of committing military coups, modern policymakers tend to implement more legal forms of anti-democratic change to undermine democracy by using constitutional rights or the courts (judicial review). The characteristic feature of abusive constitutional borrowing is to maximize the achievement of antidemocratic goal. It is a deliberate attack on the democratic minimum core, which consequently leads to a gradual erosion of democracy. Modern democracies have a tendency to move back to autocratization by combining different forms of constitutional abuses, which can be classified as constitutional changes and sub-constitutional ones with a formal or informal character.

While previous administrations have looked for ways to exert closer control over parts of government they are ideologically at odds with, the Trump administration has gone further. It has sidelined administrative expertise and scientists in many areas, selecting senior leaders whose lack of qualification is frequently matched only by their disdain for their organizational mission. To achieve its goals, the Trump administration has shown a willingness to push the boundaries of the law beyond its breaking point. While avoiding a direct attack on the civil service via a governmentwide reform, the Trump administration has sought to weaken the ability of public sector unions to negotiate for benefits, punished individuals and units deemed not to be politically loyal, and weakened oversight bodies such as Inspectors General. All of this has been accompanied by a rhetoric of delegitimization, where the President and his supporters frequently invoke conspiratorial theories of “deep state” plots that have been embedded in the Republican Party.

As its members could not claim their constitutional rights as citizens of Turkey, emigration soared and the minority reached a point of near extinction. Significant improvements were noted when the EU-supported reform transformed the Turkish state and society from 1999 to 2010, which were not reversed as Turkey relapsed to democratic backsliding in the following years.

Recent empirical evidence, however, has shown that there is a significant variation in middle class support for democracy. How do educated elites respond to declines in democracy? To date, we know relatively little about how the educated elites view, talk, and respond as democracy erodes in their country. We address this gap by conducting a discourse analysis of government and educated elites texts in Indonesia from 2010 through 2020. We find that government and educated elites’ discourses on democracy as democracy backslides tend to diverge significantly: While official texts boast of the Indonesia's identity as a Muslim-majority democracy, materials produced by the country's educated middle class express increasing disenchantment with weak political parties, restrictions on freedom of speech, repressive measures toward government critics, and limited checks on executive overreach. Our results suggest that as democracy erodes, government officials’ narratives continue to present the country as a robust democracy, and as such, official narratives alone would not reveal the cracks in democracy in the early stages of decline. Instead, traces of decline are more visible in everyday discourses, where informed citizens express their concerns and criticisms with less fear of reprisals. Rather than standing with the ruling elites, the educated elite authors and producers in our data respond to democratic erosion by resisting and criticizing illiberal measures and demanding greater protection of rights.

We compare the profile of 157 leaders having competed in 81 elections worldwide between June 2016 and July 2019 – including 14 leaders with autocratic tendencies (Putin, Trump, Bolsonaro, Erdoğan, Orbán, Duterte, Netanyahu and several others). Using the ratings provided by 1800+ scholars we show that autocrats score significantly lower on agreeableness and emotional stability, and (marginally) higher on extraversion. Autocrats also score significantly higher than non-autocrats on the Dark Triad (narcissism, psychopathy and Machiavellianism), even when compared to right-wing non-autocrats.

Three cases of post-Communist states in the EU’s immediate neighbourhood were studied: Poland, Croatia and Ukraine, over the time period 1990 to 2013. The interplay between external and domestic factors was studied in terms of the policy approach employed by the EU, the receptiveness of political elites to EU influence, and the level of pro-EU civil society activity. The evidence from this study seems to suggest that the EU policy approach was successful with potential member states in Central and Eastern Europe, such as Poland, although the problem of democratic backsliding post-accession later emerged, to which the EU had no immediate policy approach. The EU’s policy approach in the Western Balkans appears to have had some success, seen in the case of Croatia, but it is unclear whether this success will be replicated in the more problematic cases, such as Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo. The EU’s policy approach through its European Neighbourhood Policy has not been successful in the East, exemplified in the case of Ukraine. Domestic factors, and in particular the receptivity of the political elite to EU influence, appear to remain the most important in explaining whether the EU is able to engage with potential new member states.

At the same time, there is growing discussion of democratic backsliding and concern that democracies are exhibiting extremism, weakening of opposition forces and constitutional courts, and violations of civil and political rights that are pertinent to vibrant democracies. Scholars try to study both phenomena and understand the relationship between them. Israel is an important case study for both agendas. This Article analyzes the jurisprudence of Aharon Barak, one of the greatest jurists of our time with a worldwide reputation for revolutionizing both Israeli constitutional law and comparative constitutional law. It explains the tactics and strategy used by Barak to revolutionize Israeli constitutional law on issues of reasonableness, proportionality, standing, justiciability, constitutional review, equality, and supra-constitutional law. It reveals how each revolution paved the way for the next. It offers explanations for the effectiveness of these judicially-led revolutions as well as possible bases for their legitimation. Barak was a common law judge and ultimately treated parliamentary sovereignty as a doctrine arising from common law and constrained by common law, though he never quite put it in these terms. The Article concludes with explanations for the political backlash experienced by the current Israeli Supreme Court that some have characterized as democratic backsliding. It argues that the Court contributes to the development of law as part of a dialog and interaction between the different branches of government. As the Court operates within these dynamics, it must understand and take into account the institutional, political, and social environments in which it operates to preserve legitimacy and achieve efficacy. Barak was a strategic player that laid foundations for an expansive judicial power, but his Court was very prudent in utilizing that power. His successors may have contributed unintentionally to the backlash against the Court by following Barak’s substantive jurisprudence, but not necessarily his prudent tactics and strategy.", :year 2018, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes ["Review"], :journal {:name "The Law & Ethics of Human Rights", :pages "227 - 272", :volume "14"}, :authors [{:authorId "118200938", :name "R.

Empirical evidence generally supports this claim. Yet by asking judges to hold leaders accountable, systems of constitutional review can create political tensions. Judicial institutions are sometimes attacked, judges sometimes impeached, and judicial orders are sometimes ignored. These processes can undermine independence in a variety of ways. We argue that if independent courts are to encourage regime stability, they must do so by managing these conflictual political contexts. Political contexts in which judges believe that overt political attacks are probable are unlikely to support an important role of judicial independence in regime maintenance; however, judges can contribute to regime stability even in contexts in which their decisions are sometimes ignored. Non-compliance with judicial orders need not be a problem for a robust political system. Indeed, to impact regime stability, judges must be willing to risk being ignored. We evaluate empirical implications of this argument in a study of democratic and autocratic regime survival. ∗Please send all correspondence to Jeffrey K. Staton.

Staton is Associate Professor of Political Science at Emory University. Christopher Reenock is Associate Professor of Political Science at Florida State University. Staffan Lindberg is Professor of Political Science at University of Gothenburg. Perceptions that political leaders have violated fundamental limits on their authority are common sources of political instability (Boix and Svolik 2013, Diamond, Linz and Lipset 1995, Linz and Stepan 1996, Linz 1978, O’Donnell and Schmitter 1986). Managing beliefs about the extent to which leaders are constrained thus represents a critical governance challenge. Scholars have long suggested that independent judiciaries might be an important piece of the solution to this challenge.1 On one account, independent judges are core parts of the institutional infrastructure that produce credible commitments to regime rules, notably promises to respect private property rights (e.g. North, Summerhill and Weingast 2000, Voigt, Gutmann and Feld 2015). A related, but distinct line of thought, is that independent courts offer a kind of “insurance policy” to political coalitions that expect to lose power (Ginsburg 2003, Finkel 2008). Fearful that new leaders might unravel a regime’s rules, outgoing leaders supply institutional arrangements that constrain themselves, as well as future governments. Whatever the mechanism, by supplying potential victims of state overreach with an effective avenue of redress, independent judges help stabilize regimes. Empirical evidence supports this claim, finding that independent judiciaries promote regime survival and prevent democratic backsliding (Gibler and Randazzo 2011, Reenock, Staton and Radean 2013). Despite this sanguine view of independent courts, additional facts are somewhat unsettling. Peak courts broadly understood to be independent of sitting governments have been central players in the collapse of democratic regimes. Notably, conflicts between the Supreme Court of Chile and Salvador Allende in 1973 and between the Supreme Court of Honduras and Manuel Zelaya in 2009 created legal grounds that coup-plotters would use to rationalize their actions (Ruhl 2010, Valenzuela 1978). In addition, courts seeking to constrain leaders are often the target of institutional attacks (Helmke 2010, Pérez-Liñán and Castagnola 2009). Indeed, in 2007, Bolivia’s Constitutional Tribunal was rendered inquorate as a consequence of politically motivated impeachments and resignations in the context of major conflict between the judiciary and President Evo Morales (Castagnola and Pérez-Liñán 2011). Scholars also recognize that judicial orders are not self-enforcing, a challenge that is particularly pressing when the target of an order is the state itself (Becker and Feeley 1973, Birkby 1966). 1By independent judiciaries, we mean judiciaries whose decisions largely reflect judges’ sincere evaluation of the records before them (Kornhauser 2002)", :year 2015, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes ["Review"], :journal nil, :authors [{:authorId "96030418", :name "K.

Political scholars had generally praised the country’s democratic achievements and stability in the two decades following the 1998 resignation of long-serving president Suharto. But more recently, a growing number of academics have noted that elements of Indonesia’s democracy are being eroded. While the issue of Indonesia’s democratic backsliding has gained considerable attention and generated much academic literature, few scholars have analyzed why Indonesia has not entered a phase of rapid backsliding or a return to authoritarianism.

Even though such a phenomenon may occur in different types of democracies, there is always a threshold that determines whether the state will completely backslide to autocracy or conserve being a “minimal democracy”. For instance, a current model of democratic backsliding is Turkey; a state which has been experiencing a decline in basic civil liberties, political rights and freedoms. According to Freedom House, from 2002 to 2020, Turkey’s “political environment” has decreased from 23 to 31 (on a scale of 0 to 40, 40 being the worst); moreover, its “global freedom” has deteriorated to 32 (on a scale of 100, 100 being the worst), which labeled it “not free”, compared to being “partly free” in 2002 (Freedom House, 2020). Indeed, the literature indicates that such decline mostly stemmed from Erdoğan’s personalization of institutions and control of the military’s political power after the attempted coup of July 2016. Nevertheless, when examining the literature on democratization, studies reveal that undermining the political influence of the military is crucial to consolidate democracy, yet in the Turkish case that did not happen (Droz-Vinznet, 2014: 668). Accordingly, an emerging puzzle is: why does a regime continue to backslide from democracy despite de-politicizing its military? How do other personalized institutions, within a state, determine the outcome of democratic transitions? Looking at Turkey under Erdoğan and the AKP, this thesis aims to examine the causes of democratic backsliding in relation to the de-politicization of the military. 1 The AKP: The Justice and Development Party, known in Turkey by its Turkish acronym AKP (Adalet ve Kalkinma Partisi).", :year 2021, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal nil, :authors [{:authorId "2121281477", :name "Yasmina Khaled Elazazi"}]} {:paperId "52fd4ba1e08eb97189866ce55200a0a19bb73f95", :title "Strongman: The Extraordinary Leaders of India and the Philippines", :abstract "Both Narendra Modi and Rodrigo Duterte stand out as leaders that epitomise their respective reigns in ways that previous leaders did not.

The region has been home of some of the most impressive success stories of economic growth and human development in the post-World War II period. Starting in Singapore in the early 1970s and followed by Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia, the region as a whole achieved and sustained a remarkable rate of economic growth, faster than in any other regional grouping in the world in the same period, except for Northeast Asia. In the 1990s and 2000s, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia also made significant progress in terms of economic growth and human development. In the 2010s, even Myanmar has begun to recover from 50 years of military-imposed desolation (Coxhead 2018). Growth and modernisation have improved the livelihood of hundreds of millions of Southeast Asians. At the same time, however, the “pursuit of rushed development” has resulted in a “compressed modernity” that has “strained the social fabric of the societies” and “neglected the democratic process” (Dragolov, Koch and Larsen 2018:100). For sure, Southeast Asia has seen transitions from authoritarian rule to democratic governance in recent decades and the number of democracies increased from zero in 1975 to four in 2005 (Croissant and Bünte 2012). This said, there is a growing concern that – after a period of political liberalisation and of democratic opening – democracy is backsliding in Southeast Asia as countries such as Cambodia, the Philippines, Thailand, Myanmar, and Indonesia exemplified a continued decay of democratic institutions, rights, freedoms and norms in the past ten years, or so (Croissant 2019). In addition to socio-economic modernisation and political liberalisation, a third trend has shaped regional trajectories in recent decades.

It uses a “modes of participation” (MOP) approach that is informed by a Gramscian theorization of the state-society complex. It is argued that Turkey’s neo-liberal capitalist development during the Justice and Development Party (AKP) era has not been conducive to allowing for the formation of cohesive alliances in support of liberal democratic representation. Instead, the country’s already oppressed and divided labour force has further been fragmented under the neo-liberal economic policy, while its middle and business classes have supported democracy only when it has been in their interest, and intellectuals have been co-opted. Hence, the way the AKP governs Turkey is not because of weak or ineffective state institutions. It is rather rooted in the structural tensions in Turkey’s capitalist development that require the ruling elites’ mediation through a variety of parliamentary and extra-parliamentary mechanisms of resource allocation to maintain their dominant position in the political arena.", :year 2023, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "Democratization", :pages "741 - 761", :volume "30"}, :authors [{:authorId "108197732", :name "S.

Yet even in the context of de-democratization, participation in parliamentary hearings/committees is of pivotal importance for expertise provision.

Two arguments are put forward: First, such attacks have emerged in the context of a populist narrative against institutions facilitating social mobility. Social mobility undermines the “us versus them” populist narrative where the masses are permanently placed on the “losers” side and therefore depend on the charismatic populist leader. With social mobility facilitated through high-quality academic institutions, these “losers” have the chance to improve their material and non-material well-being through education.

The IBB was won in 2019 by a broad coalition of parties centered around Ekrem İmamoğlu of the Republican People’s Party (CHP). This transfer of power occurred after a quarter century of rule by Islamist parties; the Welfare Party (Refah Partisi) ruled from 1994 to 2002 and was superseded by the Justice and Development Party (Adalet ve Kalkınma Partisi, AKP), which took power in 2002 and witnessed the progression of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan from metropolitan mayor to prime minister, and eventually, president.

If it ceases to be a union of Rule-of-Law-abiding democracies, the European Union (EU) is unthinkable. Purely political mechanisms to safeguard the Rule of Law, such as those in Article 7 Treaty of European Union (TEU), do not work. Worse still, their existence has disguised the fact that the violations of the values of Article 2 TEU are also violations of EU law. The legal mechanisms tried thus far, however, do not work either. The fundamental jurisprudence on judicial independence and irremovability under Article 19(1) TEU is a good start, but it has been unable to change the situation on the ground. Despite ten years of EU attempts at reining in Rule of Law violations and even as backsliding Member States have lost cases at the Court of Justice, illiberal regimes inside the EU have become more consolidated: the EU has been losing through winning. More creative work is needed to find ways to enforce the values of Article 2 TEU more effectively. Taking this insight, we propose to turn the EU into a militant democracy, able to defend its basic principles, by using the traditional tools for the enforcement of EU law in a novel manner. We demonstrate how the familiar infringement actions—both under Article 258 and 259 TFEU—can be adapted as instruments for enforcing EU values by bundling a set of specific violations into a single general infringement action to show how a pattern of unlawful activity rises to the level of being a systemic violation. A systemic violation, because of its general and pervasive nature, in itself threatens basic values above and beyond violations of individual provisions of the acquis. Certified by the Court of Justice, a systemic violation of EU law should call for systemic compliance that would require the Member State to undo the effects of its attacks on the values of Article 2. The use of Article 260 Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) to deduct fines from EU funds due to be received by the troubled Member State would provide additional incentives for systemic compliance. We illustrate this proposed militant democratic structure by explaining and critiquing what the Commission and Court together have done to reign in the governments of Hungary and Poland so far and then showing how they can do better.", :year 2020, :openAccessPdf {:url "https://pure.rug.nl/ws/files/671878324/yeaa012.pdf", :status "GREEN"}, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "Yearbook of European Law"}, :authors [{:authorId "103451154", :name "K.

This article argues that the EU is a militant democracy in a specific and limited sense, but that this may be normatively undesirable from a democratic perspective. I first develop a definition of militant democracy that focuses on the militant democratic paradox. I argue that the strongest justifications for militant democracy require that two conditions are met: an ‘existential threat condition’ and a ‘necessity condition’. Next, I analyse four ways in which the European Union has been said to be empowered to act in a militant democratic fashion to combat democratic backsliding in EU member states. I show how some, though not all, of these warrant the label ‘militant democracy’. Moving from the descriptive to the normative analysis, I then consider whether the necessity condition can ever be met since there is always the possibility of non-militant responses through forms of EU disintegration.

The new populism in ECE differs from other populisms because it combines the elements of populism, ethnonationalism, and authoritarianism. Adhering to a similar script, which consists of sustained attacks on rule of law institutions, civil rights and freedoms, the media, and electoral rules, both populist governments in a relatively short period of time dismantled almost all the key cornerstones of democracy in Hungary and Poland. The current surge of populism in ECE demonstrates that constitutional democracy is in great danger when its core principles no longer enjoy wide democratic support. Paradoxically, constitutional democracy can play its “counter-majoritarian” role only when a majority of the people believe that it is the only game in town. Ultimately, democratic political parties and social movements with credible political ideas and programs offer the best hope for the survival of constitutional democracy.

The economic voting scholarship has established that the clarity of responsibility, i.e., government accountability for economic conditions to the mass public, is a necessity for electoral reward or punishment for economic performance. On the one hand, political centralization, which reduces the number of veto players, may increase the visibility of the role of the executive in policy success or failure. On the other hand, it allows an uncontested blame avoidance discourse, especially when accompanied with democratic backsliding. Furthermore, the recent backlash against globalization has enabled blame shifting to international actors in many countries. Against this theoretical framework, we comparatively analyze the responsibility attribution discourses for the 1994, 2001, and 2018-2022 financial crises in the statements of incumbent presidents, ministers, and parliament members of Turkey. We find that while blame avoidance discursive strategies have been attempted in all three cases, the responsibility attribution for the 1994 and 2001 crises mostly targeted the executive.

Reflecting on the urgent scholarly need among students of Arab and Middle Eastern politics to address the crisis of democratisation is imperative. A line-up of social scientists comes together to do just that: a focused and in-depth engagement with the problematic of the crisis of democratisation. To this end, the contributors in this Special Issue offer a ‘soft’ theorisation of the crisis of democratisation in the context of the ‘Arab Spring’ and its aftermath. Such an undertaking seeks at once context-focused analysis and sensitivity to the ‘specific’. That is, a set of articles that embraces multivocality of specialism, interpretation, methodology and positionality. We address the problematic by focusing on what qualifies as ‘democratic backsliding,’ alternatively called ‘setbacks,’ ‘regressions,’ etc. This is one means for outlining the anatomy of the Arab region’s own ‘democratisation crisis’ over twelve years after the ‘Arab Spring’ uprisings that heralded cascading socio-political changes in the region, Maghreb included. What possible comparative representations can be gleaned from our attempt to deconstruct the Arab democratisation crisis? How are they manifested and experienced empirically and discursively? The articles in this Special Issue attempt to contextualise and analyse this phenomenon through diverse case studies, accounting for the social and political matrices in which democratic backsliding is incubated. In so doing, the contributors collectively bring to the fore both commonalities and particularities of Arab polities that can no longer escape the conundrum of ‘reform or perish’.

The joint characteristic of these cases is that they represent ethnically, religiously or politically, ideologically deeply divided societies and/or failed states, which offer an alternative idea of non-Euro-Atlantic liberal constitutionalism in an age of ‘multiple constitutionalism’.

This light approach enables him to cover much terrain, even turning the occasional corner-cutting nature of his discussion into an advantage. Although published in 2021, it is relevant today in view of the ultraconservative 2022 US Supreme Court rulings (severely limiting the right to have an abortion, states’ capacity to regulate guns, and the federal government’s ability to regulate the environment—among other things). While the book succeeds in putting a critical realist mirror in front of mainstream liberal constitutionalists, it is not entirely clear why it focuses exclusively on North American constitutionalism, leaving aside the comparative scholarship of the last decade. This scholarship considers democratic backsliding, constitutional capture, and retrogression elsewhere, in settings as diverse as Hungary, Poland, Brazil, India, Turkey and Israel. Hutchinson’s account is largely framed as a general critique of oft-complacent liberal constitutionalism, not merely of its North American variant (assuming, as Hutchinson does, that such a unified US-Canada variant even exists—an assumption that some would vehemently contest). Likewise, Hutchinson does not refer to the empirically rigorous and theoretically advanced accounts of judicial decision making that cast serious doubt about the Dworkinian notion of Herculean judges that are removed from politics and are tasked with preserving the enduring values of the polity. And despite Hutchinson’s proposals for institutional changes, the book’s broad treatment of democracy, in particular of the participatory variant—supposedly a viable alternative to high-voltage “legal constitutionalism”—remains an abstract, pie-in-the-sky notion that is not discussed at all. In summary, while lifelong scholars of constitutional theory and constitutional history in the United States and Canada might only find modestly novel insights here, Hutchinson’s intellectual honesty, his commanding grasp of the American and, in particular, the Canadian constitutional terrains, and above all his accessible and captivating presentation more than make up for that.

Building upon recent literature on backsliding, we offer a new conceptualization of the notion of democratic authoritarianism, denoting the use of democratic-looking institutions for the expansion of authoritarian forms of power across different regime types, democratic and authoritarian. Whereas existing accounts of autocratization focus overwhelmingly on the executive, we outline democratic authoritarianism as a broader process involving mechanisms of institutional and ideational capture, which may be initiated and implemented by executives, legislatures, judiciaries as well as non-state organizations, often acting in tandem. Our notion of democratic authoritarianism can explain autocratization in states with both strong and weak elected executives; it recognizes the role of anti-pluralist ideologies and civil society organizations in enabling autocratization. We illustrate our argument through a comparative analysis of contemporary South Asia, which we argue illustrates different variants of democratic authoritarianism. Through detailed case studies of India and Pakistan since 2014, we show that South Asia is significant for understandings of autocratization, notably, the range of instruments deployed and the different stages of democratic authoritarianism, the interplay between state and societal institutions, and the limits of commonly suggested remedies, notably empowering the judiciary and civil society.", :year 2022, :openAccessPdf {:url "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/13510347.2022.2062324?needAccess=true", :status "HYBRID"}, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "Democratization", :pages "1375 - 1396", :volume "29"}, :authors [{:authorId "89094781", :name "Rochana Bajpai"} {:authorId "84107277", :name "Yasser Kureshi"}]} {:paperId "5ea2b87e8ab63bf3350c3f81ed1c1e8cf93ad841", :title "Gender equality backlash in contexts of democratic backsliding and rising authoritarianism", :abstract "During the past two decades, much local and Western scholarship has emerged analysing the rise in authoritarian, anti-human rights, nationalist and conservative trends around the world that have a direct impact on gender (in)equality.1 They jeopardise earlier hard-fought gains in gender equality, particularly policies that followed the 1995 Fourth World Conference on Women, in fields as diverse as political participation, labour market, care, and violence against women.2", :year 2022, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal nil, :authors []} {:paperId "5f4a58a36d18f7fefba4410a3c6aa8818fe07ecb", :title "Reversibility of Illiberalism", :abstract "\nFrom 2006 to 2016, North Macedonia experienced a period of democratic backsliding and illiberalism.

Samuel Huntington described this global shift as “Democracy's Third Wave” in an article published in 1991, which was later developed in a book titled The Third Wave: Democratization in the Late Twentieth Century. In these two works, he discusses the causes, features, and transition processes of the third wave of democracy and examines its prospects for sustainability and possible expansion in a nondemocratic world. He argues that the first and second democratic waves “were followed not merely by some backsliding but major reverse waves during which most regime changes throughout the world were from democracy to authoritarianism” (Huntington, 1991a). He also addresses the causative factors of this reverse wave in some countries, and he claims that the third wave of democratization that swept the world in the 1970s and 1980s might become a dominant feature of Middle Eastern and North African politics in the 1990s. The delay in this prophecy for two decades motivates us to question whether the Arab Spring is part of Huntington's third wave of democratization or a new fourth wave of democratization, or even a false start to democracy, as described by Larry Diamond (2011). The purpose of this article is to examine the causes, features, and transition processes of the Arab Spring in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, and Yemen in correlation with Huntington's theorization on the third wave of democratization which, along with other available literature in the field, will be combined in a theoretical framework that will enable us to discuss the abovementioned elements of the Arab Spring through the lens of the third wave of democratization. Special attention is paid to the question of whether the Arab Spring falls into the framework of Huntington's theory, or whether it can be classified as a new fourth wave of democratization in countries that have unfavorable environments for democracy. The first part of this article highlights the causative factors that eased the emergence of the third wave of democratization in different parts of the world.

In this chapter, our focus is democratic backsliding aided by populist rhetoric. Some have suggested deliberative democracy as a means to combat this form of populism. Deliberative democracy encourages and facilitates both consultation and contestation, emphasizing plurality of voices, the legitimacy of disagreement, and the imperative of reasoned persuasion. Its participatory and inclusive character has the potential to undermine the credibility of populists’ claims to speak for a unitary people. Ireland has been widely referenced in constitutionalism’s deliberative turn, given its recent integration of deliberative mini-publics into the constitutional amendment process. Reviewing the Irish experience, we suggest that deliberative mini-publics are unlikely to reverse democratic backsliding. Populist rhetoric is fueled by the very measures intended to combat democratic backsliding: enhanced constitutional constraints merely illustrate how the will of the people is being thwarted. The virtues of Ireland’s experiment in deliberative democracy — citizen participation, integration with representative democracy, deliberation, balanced information, expertise — have all been criticized in ways that are at least consistent with populist narratives. The failure of such narratives to take hold in Ireland, we suggest, may be due to a political system that is already resistant to populist rhetoric, as well as a tradition of participatory constitutionalism. The experiment with deliberative mini-publics may have strengthened Ireland’s constitutional culture by reinforcing anti-populist features.

The household economic condition was validated by a report on deprivation and the presented growth of households’ disposable income, exposing regional differences between the selected voivodeships. The populist party Law and Justice (PiS) won the two last elections, with the majority of votes in low-income regions, which proved the hypothesis that economic inequality, amplified by globalisation and transition disparities were the main reasons for populism's prevalence.

This cleavage, while divisive, has been a strength of Indonesia's democracy, giving meaning to political participation and allowing a degree of representation not often observed in young democracies.

And why do some democracies remain stable or improve their level of democracy while others “backslide” or even die? These are the big questions this book seeks to answer. Advances and setbacks in democracy are among the most important events in modern world history, as consequential as wars, economic recessions, and pandemics. Democracy is the only political regime that is designed to foster human dignity and individual freedoms for all citizens. Recent studies also provide rigorous evidence that democracy promotes economic growth (Acemoglu et al. 2019), helps prevent catastrophic economic outcomes (Knutsen 2021), and lowers infant mortality (Wang et al. 2019). Transitions to democracy more than double spending on poverty alleviation (Murshed et al. 2020), increase life expectancy, reduce child mortality, and lower deaths from noncommunicable diseases (Bollyky et al. 2019). In contrast, autocratizing countries have substantially lower estimated life expectancy, less effective health service coverage, and higher levels of out-of-pocket health spending than they would have had without erosion of democratic rights and freedoms (Wigley et al. 2020). Furthermore, the democratic peace axiom – that democracies do not fight wars against each other and that the spread of democracy reduces armed disputes and wars – is soundly confirmed by recent rigorous studies (e.g., Altman et al. 2021; Hegre et al. 2020); and other studies demonstrate that democracies are less prone to civil war and domestic volatility compared to less democratic regimes (Fjelde et al. 2021; Hegre 2014). In short, advances and setbacks have real implications for the well-being and freedom of millions of people. As we write this book, the world is experiencing a “wave of autocratization,” with a third of the population living under “autocratizing” conditions (Lührmann and Lindberg 2019).

The goal of this exploratory paper is to examine Poland’s efforts to promote democracy through foreign aid in Ukraine. I find that after winning the elections in 2015, the populist government in Poland started to transform democracy aid both at the level of development cooperation policy and in practice in Ukraine, one of the biggest beneficiaries of Polish aid. Rather than explicitly questioning or limiting aid as an instrument of democracy promotion, support for civil society and human rights has been reduced, and the involvement of Polish NGOs, especially those strongly committed to transferring democratic values abroad, declined. Such changes are perceived as another layer of Poland’s democratic backsliding rooted in the anti-pluralism of the Law and Justice party.

A Hirschmanian Hypothesis", :abstract "Mobility within the EU is normally understood as economic: a flow from poor members from Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) to the wealthier West which recently replaced a similar flow from the poorer South to the North. It is rarely noticed, however, that the same flows represent also movement from lower quality democracies to higher quality ones. If so, it is plausible to expect that this movement, on a scale unseen in Europe since WWII, will have some feedback effect on the quality of democracy too. Indeed, as we know from Albert Hirschman, citizens are facing a perennial dilemma between ‘voice’ and ‘exit’. The other choice they have to make according to him is between investing their time and energy in actions in the public sphere and pursuit of private welfare. By facilitating the exit option on one side and enhancing the opportunities for private prosperity on the other, the Union, for all the great things it provides, may subvert democracy in the member states. This effect may be negligible in most of the ‘old’ member states which have not seen significant outward migration but it should be very strong in the ‘new’ member states in the East. \n \nThus, the paper aims to initiate the systematic exploration of the relationship between emigration and democratic backsliding which is currently the most characteristic trend in CEE. It begins by an exploration of the dynamics of mobility, participation and private welfare which may (or may not) come into play in the context of European integration and of the free movement of people in particular. This is followed by a brief discussion of the available evidence for the relationship between mobility and political participation – all of it from other contexts.

Similarly, although scholars have analyzed party building (see Steven Levitsky et al., “Introduction: Challenges of Party-Building in Latin America,” in Challenges of Party-Building in Latin America, 2016) and party system collapse (see Jana Morgan, Bankrupt Representation and Party System Collapse, 2011), Cyr gives the question a new twist. She does not seek to unveil the causes of either of these phenomena, but rather explores why existing parties (fail to) survive national electoral crises. Her analysis bridges the aforementioned literature with debates regarding what a party is and how to measure its strength. Unlike most analyses in comparative politics, which focus almost exclusively on electoral outcomes, Cyr follows the literature on the United States and conceptualizes parties as organizations that operate both in the electorate and in public opinion. With that in mind, she rethinks party strength. Resources are commonly mentioned to understand party building (see Adrienne LeBas, From Protest to Parties: Party Building and Democratization in Africa, 2011); however, Cyr goes further and unpacks the concept. She differentiates the type of resources that parties have, what they need to attain these resources, and the specific purposes these resources serve. The Fates of Political Parties and State Crisis in Fragile Democracies stand out methodologically as well. Handlin’s use of process tracing is very rigorous. Although comparative historical analysis can and is often used interchangeably for theory building and theory testing, Handlin separates these two objectives. He developed most of his hypotheses before collecting data and then used process tracing to assess them. To do so, he outlined three causal mechanisms and drew explicit hypotheses for every step in each one of them. He then assessed these hypotheses with data (empirical observations) and used process tracing tests – “hoop,” “straw in the wind,” “doubly decisive,” and “smoking gun” – to evaluate the strength of his evidence. Handlin’s book is an excellent example of how scholars can improve transparency in qualitative methods. Cyr’s methodological contributions are equally impressive. Her book is a prime example of mixed-methods research. She measured organizational resources using expert surveys and interviews, and ideational resources using secondary sources, interviews, and, most notably, focus groups. The last methodology, an increasingly popular technique in political science, allowed her to measure abstract resources, such as branding. She triangulated the collected data to maximize measurement accuracy. Notwithstanding their methodological and theoretical contributions, Cyr’s and Handlin’s books have some shortcomings. Although Handlin’s book relies heavily on the existence (or lack) of left-wing mobilization infrastructure, that infrastructure is never properly defined and seems, at points, tautological. In Brazil, for example, the strength of the Left manifests in the Worker Party’s (PT) electoral success (pp. 102–5). In Venezuela, on the contrary, it manifests in the existence of experienced left-wing professionals, regardless of the fragmentation and extensive electoral losses of the leftwing parties Movimiento al Socialismo (MAS) and La Causa R (pp. 58–61). Similarly, in Uruguay and Chile, the strength of the Left is measured at the party level, whereas in Ecuador and Bolivia it is measured at the grassroots social movement level. Are all of these “Lefts” equally powerful? What type of resources did each leader tap into? To what extent did the availability of different types of resources shape subsequent regime outcomes? The theory outlined in The Fates of Political Parties seems particularly well posed to answer some of these questions. Cyr could also have benefited from Handlin’s work. Although all of the cases in her book deal with party system collapse followed by severe backsliding and even regime change, unlike Handlin, she ignores regime dynamics in her analysis. Electoral competition in Perú, Venezuela, and Bolivia became increasingly unfair after Fujimori, Chávez, and Morales, respectively, came to power. Parties in these contexts faced a shortage of lowcost resources particular to competitive authoritarian regimes. It is unclear how the uneven access to resources and the media, or the manipulation of electoral rules, affected the availability of other resources or parties’ opportunity to use them. National electoral crises need not lead to democratic erosion: What happens when parties and party systems face significant transformations, but access to the media and electoral resources does not change? Would that modify the resource calculation? Would that make some resources more likely to promote survival (and/or revival) than others? Party and regime dynamics have been closely related in Latin America. The books analyzed here provide both interesting theoretical insights and pose provocative questions to further analyze these phenomena.", :year 2019, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes ["Review"], :journal {:name "Perspectives on Politics", :pages "909 - 911", :volume "17"}, :authors [{:authorId "117481381", :name "M.

In the past few decades, the wages of most workers have stagnated, even as productivity increased. Social supports have been cut, while corporations have achieved record profits. Downward mobility has produced political backlash. What is going on? Can Democracy Survive Global Capitalism? argues that neither trade nor immigration nor technological change is responsible for the harm to workers’ prospects. According to Robert Kuttner, global capitalism is to blame. By limiting workers’ rights, liberating bankers, allowing corporations to evade taxation, and preventing nations from assuring economic security, raw capitalism strikes at the very foundation of a healthy democracy. The resurgence of predatory capitalism was not inevitable. After the Great Depression, the U.S. government harnessed capitalism to democracy. Under Roosevelt’s New Deal, labor unions were legalized, and capital regulated. Well into the 1950s and ’60s, the Western world combined a thriving economy with a secure and growing middle class. Beginning in the 1970s, as deregulated capitalism regained the upper hand, elites began to dominate politics once again; policy reversals followed. The inequality and instability that ensued would eventually, in 2016, cause disillusioned voters to support far-right faux populism. Is today’s poisonous alliance of reckless finance and ultranationalism inevitable? Or can we find the political will to make capitalism serve democracy, and not the other way around? Charting a plan for bold action based on political precedent, Can Democracy Survive Global Capitalism? is essential reading for anyone eager to reverse the decline of democracy in the West.Freedom in the World is the standard-setting comparative assessment of global political rights and civil liberties.

These analyses have criticized governments throughout the Middle East, Africa, and Asia for anti-democratic and autocratic methods. However, Freedom House’s important work researching authoritarianism and democracy throughout the world should start to focus once again on its birthplace—the Western world. Freedom House, based in the United States (and largely funded by government agencies such as the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development), could be—and has been—accused of having Western biases. A quick look at Freedom in the World 2014 shows that the United States and Canada, as well as the majority of European nations, are classified as “free” right up to the Ukrainian border. 1 However, several countries in Europe—as Freedom House rightly notes—have suffered democratic backsliding. France, Switzerland, and Hungary have all passed laws or gone through social movements seeking to limit the rights of migrants and ethnic minorities. These occurrences, though noted in Freedom House’s analysis, do not seriously affect the calculations within. Hungary itself is an excellent example of where this analysis has masked the more sinister undertones within an open democracy. Hungary’s recent re-election of Viktor Orban—in an election widely seen as free and fair—can be seen as a backwards turn for Hungarian democracy.

In this paper, we suggest a series of classroom interventions–in information literacy, conceptualization, and losers’ consent–which can help students leverage social science research skills to analyze current events without falling into undesirably heated partisan discussion.

First, one needs to adopt a “political and relational” definition of polarization. Second, one must distinguish between exclusionary and inclusionary polarizations. Episodes of polarization are started by actors who re-bundle preexisting societal rifts and generate new ones to pursue political goals. But polarization becomes “pernicious,” i.e. begins to erode democracy, “relationally,” i.e. through the actions of these polarizing agents and the reactions of their opponents. In Turkey, exclusionary polarizations were instigated by nationalist elites to exclude various minorities, producing an outright undemocratic legacy. By comparison, inclusionary polarizations had democratizing potential because they were started by political entrepreneurs who pursued popular mobilizations and promised inclusive benefits to disadvantaged groups. Democratization failed in these cases due to shortcomings of intra-elite politics. Three differences distinguish the current polarization from earlier episodes. First, the current polarization, which also started as inclusionary, resulted from the AKP’s relative mass-party characteristics and anti-regime core identity. The latter factors drove the AKP to pursue more “revolutionary” policies and heightened existential threat perception among opponents. Second, the AKP’s ability to subdue authoritarian state institutions that had suppressed earlier polarizations, led to longer-lasting polarization. Consequently, polarization produced deeper social divisions and more severe democratic backsliding than earlier episodes had. Paradoxically, the cure for current polarization-cum-authoritarianism may be found in new polarizations led by democratic-reformist elite coalitions and programs.", :year 2020, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "", :volume ""}, :authors [{:authorId "39031497", :name "Murat Somer"}]} {:paperId "66af66758eae1b136ec01efb704ffff371dd573c", :title "RHETORICAL RUCKUS OR SUPRANATIONAL LEGAL THREAT ?", :abstract "Many states around the globe, most particularly in Europe, have seen a resurgence of far-right populist parties in the years following the global financial crisis.

Democracy, as a concept, has spread widely and external threats have become almost non-existent. Thus, research of democracy has turned inward in attempting to appraise its quality. Upon examination, however, it is clear that the research programme falls short of its promise. It is insufficiently comparative both conceptually and historically. Proponents seem captivated by the 'end of history' narrative in their adherence to a single standard 'liberal' democratic quality by which all regimes are assessed and ranked. Symptomatically, observers both East and West imagine Eastern European democracies as backsliding, claiming that new democracies must be externally assisted. Singular notions of good democracy lead to poor research.Consequently, it is suggested that the 'Quality of Democracy' research programme must become more reflexive. Methodologically, this implies a reckoning with the different types of democratic substance and procedure that exist as ideas and institutions. With regard to 1989, it is argued that the key to understanding the transition to democracy and the failures of democratization in Eastern Europe lies in, firstly, reckoning with the Soviet legacy; and, secondly, establishing whether a negotiated revolution occurred or not. In conclusion, the foundations for an analysis of the institutional types of Eastern European procedure and substance are offered. Thus, a historical and comparative analysis of the quality of democracy in Europe is outlined.ContentsIntroduction: The Quality of Democracy as a research programme1.

Its ascent since the SecondWorldWar has recently come to a halt. Once considered to be the only political game in town, the fate of liberal democracy is growing more uncertain as actual and aspiring authoritarians have begun to undermine its hallmark institutions. Political pluralism, separation of powers, and rule of law are increasingly called into question. The “end of history,” implying the exhaustion of viable systematic alternatives to Western liberalism (Fukuyama 1989; 2006), has failed to come closer in recent years. Instead, liberal democracy is contested as it has not been since 1945. Two trends contribute to liberal democracy’s current stagnation. On the one hand, many authoritarian regimes – China above all, but also many Middle Eastern and African states – have not faltered, as modernization theories once predicted. Rather, they have proven resilient, even in the face of external and internal pressure. On the other hand, many democracies, both old and new, have seen authoritarian backlashes. While almost complete collapses of democracy, such as in Venezuela, remain exceptions, governments in countries such as Turkey, Hungary, and Poland have implemented far-reaching illiberal reforms – hollowing out their democratic institutions. Even the United States, one of the most robust liberal democracies, has witnessed authoritarian dynamics with President Trump. In many other Western states, too, liberal democracy is under siege, as authoritarianminded parties shift political discourses and thereby influence policies, or even enter government and implement illiberal reforms. Many of these current processes of liberal-democratic backsliding are driven by populism.

Data show that persistent and growing economic disparities are linked to EU member states moving apart with regard to their democratic quality, but not as straightforwardly as the literature claims. This gives rise to two puzzles: first, economic divergence does not always go together with political divergence. While all countries in the eastern and southern periphery marked by low or declining levels of democratic quality are poor, not all poor countries are weak democratic performers. The contribution argues that weakness of state institutions as exemplified by high levels of corruption constitutes a crucial condition under which economic divergence is likely to promote political divergence. Corruption makes poor countries more likely to backslide or to perform poorly with regard to their democratic quality. Second, economic convergence is not necessarily linked to political convergence. Even in times of economic development, identity politics that caters to a strong perception of relative deprivation is likely to drive democratic backsliding in the peripheries.

In Part II, Anderson analyzes public opinion data as a means of assessing the implications of her argument that Nicaraguans (particularly those with Sandanista loyalties) will exhibit evidence of high social capital and more favorable and coherent democratic attitudes in contrast to Argentines (particularly those with loyalties linked to Peronism). The data come from surveys of two towns and from several national surveys. Unfortunately, a number of limitations pervade the data and analyses in this section, making it comparatively less satisfying than the first and third parts of the book. While Anderson may have had the ability to make some different analytical choices, much of the blame rests in problems familiar to scholars of comparative public opinion: differences in sample designs and less-than-ideal questions to proxy important attitudes. As a result, for example, much of her analysis of democratic attitudes is conducted at arm’s length and in a manner that conflates partisan loyalties with democratic preferences. Further, while she makes the explicit assumption that at least certain types of civic engagement reflect social trust, surprisingly absent is explicit analysis of indicators of interpersonal trust. This is important, as the author herself acknowledges that not all types of civic engagement are democracy enhancing; in fact, a study of contemporary public opinion in Nicaragua finds a positive relationship between interpersonal trust and only one of five types of civic engagement (see John A. Booth and Mitchell A. Seligson, Political Culture of Democracy, Nicaragua, 2010: Democratic Consolidation in the Americas in Hard Times, 2011). While critiques can be made of the survey data analyses, as a whole they provide support for the notion that civic culture, in particular with respect to civic engagement, developed differently in Nicaragua in recent times compared to Argentina. Those scholars wishing to probe more deeply into the subject will find it to be a particularly auspicious time to do so, as the amount of public opinion data available for the study of Latin American politics has virtually exploded in recent years (see Elizabeth J. Zechmeister and Mitchell A. Seligson, “Public Opinion Research in Latin America,” in Handbook of Latin American Politics, ed. Peter Kingstone and Deborah Yashar, 2012). One of the most significant aspects of this book is the argument made by Anderson regarding the potential for robust levels of social capital to emerge quickly. As a clear challenge to conventional wisdom that culture changes slowly, she provides reason to believe that in a relatively short period of time, a confluence of favorable (or unfavorable) factors can define a comprehensive mass movement that significantly influences the ways that individuals engage with one another and with their political system. Teasing out the relative importance of each “ingredient,” to use Anderson’s term, could provide excellent fodder for counterfactual and other analytical exercises on the basis of this book. Intriguingly, she notes (p. 168) that “differences between these two countries were not as pronounced in 2007 as they were in the late 1990s,” at least with respect to preferences over democracy. Thus, the book also raises the question: What factors might now be building or eroding democratic political culture so as to cause convergence across the cases? On a final note, in an era in which it is common to hear scholars and policymakers voice concern about democratic backsliding in Latin America, this book serves as a nice counterpoint by making visible some of the strengths that have recently characterized these two democratic systems: Nicaragua’s comparatively strong stock of social capital and Argentina’s comparatively strong institutions. While systems that lack both may face nearly insurmountable barriers to democratization, Social Capital in Developing Democracies provides reason to believe that countries with either high levels of civic engagement or a strong formal institutional structure may be able to hobble along at the least, or steadily progress at the most, while buying time to develop the other and achieve that best of both worlds: an engaged and democratic civic culture surrounded by strong democratic institutions.", :year 2012, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes ["Review"], :journal {:name "Perspectives on Politics", :pages "508 - 510", :volume "10"}, :authors [{:authorId "116243564", :name "Dolores Trevizo"}]} {:paperId "6796f00f5574c1bcfa77ce65bf0ffeed06a931b2", :title "Mapping institutional changes in higher education: the comparative analysis of the effects of democratic backsliding", :abstract "The world has witnessed democratic decline in 23 countries worldwide during the last decade (Freedom House, 2019) in the context of rising nationalism and right-wing populism (Fraser, 2017; Robertson, 2018, 2020). The political importance of this topic is rooted in the fact that higher education is one of the most crucial public goods (Marginson, 2007, 2017) and governments tend to exercise tighter control over HEIs while democratic conditions worsening (Perry, 2015). Although many studies have examined the effects of the transition to democracy on higher education globally (O’Donnell et al., 2013; O’Donnell et al., 1986, Salto, 2020), very few have studied the reverse trend – democratic backsliding. Given that university autonomy is a wider term that encompasses the practises undertaken by universities to operate, researching its aspects, and assessing the true implications of democratic backsliding on universities represents an important field for current and future research. \nMy research investigates the impact of democratic backsliding on the university autonomy, by examining the cases of Turkey, Hungary, and Poland.

A severe economic crisis hit in July calling into question years of economic growth and increasing prosperity. A few months later Thailand adopted a new Constitution that aimed at reforming the political system, and at making corruption and vote buying less prevalent. While this article shows that the economic turmoil was a prime catalyst for political change, it was not as simple as saying that public outcry over the economic crisis forced conservative parliamentarians into voting to accept the proposed constitution. While public outcry did matter, what is vitally important is that elite political leaders, the heads of the major parties, ministers, and generals, were renegotiating their alliances and ties both with one another, and with various groups in society that were pushing for change. Elite resignation to political pressure and policy shifts among the top leaders is what ultimately allows for the passage of the constitution and for Prime Minister Chavalit's departure. This article takes a closer look at Thai politics and tries to answer the following questions: Did the economic crisis lead to (meaningful) political reform and why or why not? Since the codification of the 1997 constitution has Thai politics become more democratic? It is my analysis that the consolidation of democracy was in reach in 1997 but today has slipped further from Thai citizens' grasp. The explanations, or the independent variables for both the successful reforms of the political system in 1997 and the backsliding away from democratization, are largely the same. When both internal and external pressures prod democracy along, reforms take place. When pressures are pushing in different directions democratic reforms become threatened. Internal pressures include the military, civil society, and the behavior and power of political and economic elites; and external ones are the IMF, national security concerns, and globalization in general.

I examine the background to the political decision to grant special autonomy to Aceh and Papua while also presenting a detailed examination of each law. The objective of this analysis is to provide a case study for policymakers and academics seeking to understand the dynamics of separatism. The analysis seeks appropriate policy responses to the challenge of secessionist movements and outlines the conditions under which granting autonomy may or may not be conducive to addressing separatist conflict.As this study illustrates, special autonomy laws were drafted in Indonesia as a response to rapidly growing independence movements in Aceh and Papua that followed the collapse of the authoritarian regime of President Suharto in 1998. Responding to mounting violence, the government offered special autonomy laws in a bid to divert secessionist demands. This offer of \"asymmetric\" autonomy in fact contained significant and special concessions for Aceh and Papua. Special autonomy was the product of an opportune moment of Indonesia's democratic transition in which the government faced multiple crises and central authority was at a weak point. With pro-independence movements intensifying their pressure on Jakarta, the government was impelled to make major concessions as a way of staving off crisis and keeping the country together.It was not long, however, before the government was able to close down the political space for independence leaders and their supporters, and address other crises challenging the state. As the government reconstituted central authority, the imperatives that had driven the decision to grant special autonomy eased. And as the government's commitment to special autonomy faltered, it soon turned to more coercive measures to respond to separatist demands. By 2003, the government was pursuing an alternative strategy of imposing martial law in Aceh and subdividing Papua, a strategy that eclipsed special autonomy and signaled a return to a more coercive, less accommodating, posture.In presenting the case study of Aceh and Papua, this essay confirms a central theme of the comparative literature on autonomy: the fragility of such arrangements and their vulnerability to reversal. Special autonomy arrangements are exceedingly difficult to entrench as national elites almost always resist demands to devolve political authority and are suspicious of any initiative that may set a precedent for other regions. This is particularly the case in large multiethnic countries such as Indonesia where the state faces an array of possible challenges to its authority. A driving force in the Indonesian government's backsliding, for instance, was the official concern that special autonomy was fuelling separatism rather than resolving it. In conceding special rights to Papua and Aceh, officials feared a cascade of similar demands from other regions.All of this suggests that special autonomy, in and of itself, does not represent a solution to separatist conflict. Rather, the concessions that are offered under special autonomy must be part of a broad process of bargaining and negotiation. In the absence of official negotiation with popular elements, autonomy arrangements typically fail to generate widespread support. In this context, central governments, which have many incentives to roll back autonomy, incur few costs in doing so. As this study illustrates, the provincial elites and national parliamentarians that formulated and enacted special autonomy in Indonesia did so largely in isolation from popular elements in both provinces. Special autonomy represented a unilateral concession on the part of Jakarta that lacked any links to the main political forces advocating independence in either province. …", :year 2004, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "", :volume ""}, :authors [{:authorId "47063967", :name "R.

Democracy in China thus appears to most outside observers as an oxymoron, a contradiction in and of itself. Yet, within the country, the party-state has consistently been framed by its leaders and in the mass media as a democratic political system, employing multiple visions of democracy with and without adjectives. Against this backdrop, the objective of this chapter is to analyse the self-perceptions and worldviews of China as a major global power and an increasingly important actor in Eurasia; it is not to normatively evaluate Chinese democracy, or to euphemise official attempts of political self-legitimation. To put it differently, the focus is not on Democracy with a capital letter as political scientists usually apply it when they discuss democracy in Western countries, or when they deplore the backsliding of democracy across the globe. Rather, the focus is on using a context-sensitive approach to explore processes of experimentation, adaptation, localization, and reinterpretation of the notion of democracy with a lowercase d, that is, as a signifier open to multiple construals by all kinds of actors, and with all kinds of motivations. When Chinese discourses about “democracy” are quoted or paraphrased in the chapter, the intention is not to spread the word but to offer a better sense of the internal logics of justification as well as of the changing tonalities in party discourse.

Systematic risks to the integrity of US elections and passive civic participation in the EU political process present fundamental threats to the constitutional aspirations and the democratic ideals connected to “We the People” in the US and “United in Diversity” in the EU. The existence of power imbalances, social inequalities and information asymmetries in electoral and political processes illustrate that both jurisdictions are in peril and in risk of democratic backsliding. Blockchain-based voting can transform existing electoral and political processes in the digital age. This raises the question whether blockchain-based voting can be utilised as a digital tool to enhance the democratic legitimacy of US and EU electoral and political systems. Accordingly, this article aims to examine the prospects and limits of blockchain technology to secure foundational democratic norms connected to the right to vote and civic participation at the heart of contemporary constitutionalism. It contends that the decentralised, immutable, accessible, transparent, and secure processes of blockchain technology have the potential to enhance the legitimacy of the US and EU constitutional orders, since blockchain-based voting can act as a forum for enhanced civic participation, public deliberation, and democratic contestation.

Evidence includes notably high levels of animosity toward out-partisans and support for undemocratic practices (SUP) among the general public. Much less is known, however, about the views of elected officials—even though they influence democratic outcomes more directly. In a survey experiment conducted with state legislators (N = 534), we show that these officials exhibit less animosity toward the other party, less SUP, and less support for partisan violence (SPV) than the general public. However, legislators vastly overestimate the levels of animosity, SUP, and SPV among voters from the other party (though not among voters from their own party). Further, those legislators randomly assigned to receive accurate information about the views of voters from the other party reported significantly lower SUP and marginally significantly lower partisan animosity toward the other party.

While those tasks remain sound, the 2010 Concept reflected a different geopolitical, geostrategic, and security environment from today’s, characterized by renewed conflict with Russia, concerns about China’s strategic and economic ambitions, and new security challenges like hybrid threats and disinformation. Considering the changed strategic landscape and emerging challenges, we argue that NATO should make several refinements to its core tasks. European Allies must improve defense capabilities, ensuring their ability to help NATO meet its core tasks. In conjunction with the other Allied nuclear powers (the United Kingdom and France), the U.S. must renew its commitment to maintaining NATO as a nuclear alliance. NATO should adopt a more rigorous operational definition of crisis management, and a more systematic emphasis on the early warning and pre-crisis phases. Finally, while national “resilience” is already implied in Article 3ʹs requirement for member states to “maintain and develop their individual and collective capacity to resist armed attack,” adding it as a fourth core task would powerfully emphasize the need for allies to address new elements of resilience, to include both technological threats and democratic backsliding.", :year 2022, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "Defence Studies", :pages "548 - 557", :volume "22"}, :authors [{:authorId "145051112", :name "R.

If the EU does too little to deal with member state regimes that go back on their commitments to democracy and the rule of law, this risks undermining the EU from within. On the other hand, if the EU takes drastic action, this might split the EU. This article explores the nature and dynamics of democratic backsliding in EU member states, and analyses the EU’s capacity, policy tools and political will to address the challenge. Empirically it draws on the cases that have promoted serious criticism from the Commission and the European Parliament: Hungary, Poland, and to a lesser extent, Romania. After reviewing the literature and defining backsliding as a gradual, deliberate, but open-ended process of de-democratization, the article analyzes the dynamics of backsliding and the EU’s difficulties in dealing with this challenge to liberal democracy and the rule of law. The Hungarian and Polish populist right’s “illiberal” projects involve centralization of power in the hands of the executive and the party, and limiting the independence of the judiciary, the media and civil society. This has brought both governments into direct confrontation with the European Commission. However, the EU’s track record in managing backsliding crises is at best mixed. This comes down to a combination of limited tools and lack of political will. Ordinary infringement procedures offer a limited toolbox, and the Commission has proven reluctant to use even these tools fully. At the same time, party groups in the European Parliament and many member state governments have been reluctant to criticize one of their own, let alone go down the path of suspending aspect of a states’ EU membership. Hence the EU’s dilemma: it is caught between undermining its own values and cohesion through inaction on one hand, and relegating one or more member states it to a second tier—or even pushing them out altogether—on the other.", :year 2019, :openAccessPdf {:url "https://www.duo.uio.no/bitstream/10852/77401/2/Democratic%2bBacksliding%2bin%2bthe%2bEuropean%2bUnion%2b10%2bMay%2b2019.pdf", :status "GREEN"}, :publicationTypes ["Review"], :journal {:name "Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Politics"}, :authors [{:authorId "119510180", :name "N.

It looks at their interactions through the lens of the legal governance of history and the historical policy implemented by the Central and East European (CEE) States, with Poland and Hungary as the prime subjects of consideration and analysis. The mushrooming of memory laws in CEE throughout the 2010s, which went handin-hand with democratic backsliding in the region, is well documented in the Special Section. Memory laws (lois mémorielles) initially emerged as a specific phenomenon within criminal law in Western Europe almost three decades ago. However, the recent wave of memory laws in CEE transcends criminal legislation and has acquired constitutional significance, which this Article analyses under the heading of mnemonic constitutionalism. After setting out an analytical framework of mnemonic constitutionalism, the Article focuses on the two specific CEE examples of Hungary and Poland. In the last decade, both countries have promulgated either constitutional (in case of Hungary) or quasiconstitutional (in case of Poland) provisions that indicate a strong turn towards mnemonic constitutionalism. The Article concludes that Fidesz (in Hungary) and PiS (in Poland) regimes perceive mnemonic constitutionalism not only as an ideological basis for the governance of historical memory but also as an ontological foundation to justify “illiberal democracies”. * Senior Researcher, T.M.C.

Second, we argue that conceptual confusion around backsliding is driven in large part by inconsistent definitions of democracy. We show how outlining a comprehensive concept of democracy enables researchers to better account for the diversity of instances of democratic backsliding.

Underlying assumptions about backsliding in CEE largely reflect a set of ideas derived from the rational institutionalist and historical institutionalist schools. Moreover, the same theoretical assumptions were previously deployed to explain the apparent success of democratization and EU leverage in CEE. A discursive institutionalism perspective, stressing the role of actors and their discourses in making and unmaking institutions, suggests that democracy in CEE was always less secure than assumed.

As a result, conspiracy theories enable the state capture camp to divide the reformist opposition and maintain their grip, while simultaneously claiming that they are governing competently and in line with European values. We use an original survey from Bulgaria and a GLOBSEC 2020 cross-national survey to explore this hypothesis. Finally, we draw some theoretical implications from the empirical evidence for assessing the nature of democratic backsliding in Eastern Europe. We call for more research on the conspiracy cleavage as a factor in explaining backsliding processes.", :year 2021, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes ["Review"], :journal {:name "Perspectives on Politics", :pages "222 - 236", :volume "20"}, :authors [{:authorId "11271431", :name "N.

And would the Constitution prevent such decay? To many, the 2016 election campaign may be the immediate catalyst for these questions. But it is structural changes to the socio-economic environment and geopolitical shifts that make the question a truly pressing one. This Article develops a taxonomy of different threats of democratic backsliding, the mechanisms whereby they unfold, and the comparative risk of each threat in the contemporary moment. By drawing on comparative law and politics experience, we demonstrate that there are two modal paths of democratic decay, which we call authoritarian reversion and constitutional retrogression. A reversion is a rapid and near-complete collapse of democratic institutions. Retrogression is a more subtle, incremental erosion that happens simultaneously to three institutional predicates of democracy: competitive elections; rights of political speech and association; and the administrative and adjudicative rule of law. Over the past quartercentury, we show that the risk of reversion has declined, while the risk of retrogression has spiked. The United States is not exceptional. We evaluate the danger of retrogression as clear and present, whereas we think reversion is much less likely. We further demonstrate that the constitutional safeguards against retrogression are weak. The near-term prospects of constitutional liberal democracy hence depend less on our institutions than on the qualities of political leadership and popular resistance.", :year 2018, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "", :volume ""}, :authors [{:authorId "115254703", :name "Aziz Z Huq"} {:authorId "2487499", :name "Tom Ginsburg"}]} {:paperId "6f18520cf69576876168a76fa350c885bfc7f6a2", :title "The rise of the democracy – authoritarianism cleavage and opposition coordination in Turkey (2014–2019)", :abstract "ABSTRACT This article examines the coordination of opposition parties in Turkey between the 2014 presidential and the 2019 local elections. To explain opposition coordination from secular, Turkish nationalist, pro-Kurdish, and Islamist parties, the article points out a rising democracy-authoritarianism cleavage. As Turkey became one of the most pronounced cases of democratic backsliding worldwide, this political cleavage gradually overshadowed historically rooted social cleavages and incentivized the opposition parties to coordinate in the name of fighting for democracy. The article shows that in seven electoral contests, the opposition parties coordinated in the form of nominating joint candidates, encouraging strategic voting, running a unified campaign, helping presidential candidates collect signatures, promising to support each other in the runoff, pledging to form a transitional government, transferring deputies to be on the ballot, nominating members of the smaller opposition parties under a larger party's list, not competing in certain districts against each other, and establishing an official alliance. Thanks to their extensive menu of coordination, the opposition parties challenged the ruling party's predominance, undermined its parliamentary majorities, and won local elections in key cities.

In this project, I argue that the partisan utility of demographic change, not racially discriminatory attitudes, underlies the motivation behind both racial threat and anti-democratic views. Across 3 surveys and 2 pre-registered experiments, I demonstrate that Republicans anti-democratic attitudes are causally determined by the inferences they make about the coming racial demographic changes in the U.S. – they assume Democrats will benefit. When I frame the changes to be advantageous to the GOP, it reshapes Republicans’ views about the value of demographic change. This reframing decreases their feelings of racial threat, and in turn leads to less anti-democratic views.

This is particularly relevant for countries in transition from authoritarian rule to democracy, where militaries can play a vital role for democratic consolidation or autocratic backsliding. Given the sensitive nature of the issue, we suspect that figures indicating strong support for the military are at least partly driven by sensitivity bias. We explore this possibility through list experiments in two nationally representative surveys in Tunisia. We find that misreporting of support for the military in Tunisia is substantial, with respondents overreporting positive attitudes by 40–50 percentage points. Moreover, misreporting is not random, but instead varies systematically by incumbency, with supporters of governing parties misreporting support for the military to a significantly higher degree than opposition supporters or non-voters.

Our empirical findings suggest that advocacy NGOs devoted to democratic quality and sustainability can continue their mission and promote or defend democracy, albeit with new incentives, strategies and goals that also depend on the existing political opportunity structures. The threat of shrinking civic space, paradoxically, has mobilized NGOs in Poland to strengthen their mission and resources, and seek wider support in society. This was possible due to new response strategies in three major areas of their operation: access, funding and networking.

Pro-government mainstream media, rather than pursuing truth, has engaged in systematic production and dissemination of simulacra. Developed by Baudrillard, the concept of simulacrum can provide insights into the truth and reality perceptions of Turkish voters. This has been a topic widely discussed, given that produced simulacra establish a legitimation framework for the Turkish government’s domestic and foreign policies. Various print and electronic sources are studied to analyse the content of speeches and used techniques. In this study, Baudrillard’s scheme will be applied for the study of three political narratives dominant in the Turkish public sphere: Turkey’s ‘struggle for survival (bekâ mücadelesi)’, the projection of key opposition leaders as ‘traitors’, and ideal leadership and diplomacy from past to present through two popular television series, ‘Diriliş Ertuğrul (Resurrection Ertuğrul)’ and ‘Payitaht Abdülhamid (Leader Abdülhamid)’.", :year 2021, :openAccessPdf {:url "http://repository.bilkent.edu.tr/bitstream/11693/77408/3/Baudrillard%20in%20Ankara%20mainstream%20media%20and%20the%20production%20of%20simulacra%20in%20the%20Turkish%20public%20sphere.pdf", :status "GREEN"}, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies", :pages "1037 - 1051", :volume "49"}, :authors [{:authorId "22348938", :name "I.

But the Bill of Rights, after all, is quite old fashioned. It does not cover many matters deemed crucial in our day, e.g., poverty. To fill this “gap” the Warren Court used “equal protection” as “actively” as the pre-Roosevelt Court had used “due process.” Obviously inspired by the Black incorporation principle, the early Burger Court is doing to substantive equal protection what the Roosevelt Court did to substantive due process. A generation ago we called it a “return to the Constitution,” now it is called strict construction.

To explain this rule of law backsliding, this thesis shows the limitations of the European Union’s efforts to sanction and punish Hungary and Poland. In addition, this thesis considers why the member states of Hungary and Poland chose to backslide during this time period. The following research questions structure the argument: Why did the EU seek to impose sanctions on Hungary and Poland for rule of law backsliding? Why did the two newer EU members, Hungary, and Poland, take steps to erode liberal democratic institutions? This combination of questions helps explain rule of law backsliding in Hungary and Poland. The justification for analyzing Hungary and Poland is to focus attention on the EU’s triggering of Article 7, which was designed to sanction countries for rule of law backsliding in the hopes of reversing these transgressions. Hungary and Poland are the only two countries to have had Article 7 triggered against them. This thesis first argues that the EU is not institutionally set up to punish illiberalism and then argues that Hungarian and Polish governments are trying to create a new form of political legitimacy based on a fusion of economic and ethno-nationalist social policies. This thesis shows support for the two arguments as 1) there is institutional weakness at the supranational level and 2) there is varying levels of effect on Hungary and Poland when considering the two phenomena of economic and migration shocks.

Close cooperation and partnership between civil society organisations and the state are scarce in backsliding countries; the relationship between civil society organisations and the state might, however, range from hostility to varying forms and degrees of co-optation.

The peculiar features of the Serbian case—a double transition to and from democracy in less than two decades—appear to support a pessimistic outlook for the future of democracy.", :year 2020, :openAccessPdf {:url "https://repositorio.ul.pt/bitstream/10451/44515/1/pdf%20secondo%20invio.pdf", :status "GREEN"}, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "Europe-Asia Studies", :pages "1617 - 1638", :volume "72"}, :authors [{:authorId "144969324", :name "Antonino Castaldo"}]} {:paperId "72deb8bf2c153328d9db4d9ee904c5a925d3bac8", :title "The Illiberal turn in Indian democracy: shifting the trajectory of India’s foreign policy", :abstract "ABSTRACT Long-standing democracies such as India were not exempt from the global trend of democratic retreat. India has come under increasing international attention due to certain domestic policies such as the revocation of Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, the National Register of Citizens and Citizenship (Amendment) Act passed under the Bharatiya Janata Party government. In addition to India’s democratic decline being reflected in global democratic rankings, this has induced strains on India’s foreign relations. In its pursuit of becoming a leading power, India’s perceived democratic backsliding is likely to influence the direction of its foreign policy. To discern the impact of its perceived illiberal turn on its foreign engagement, the role of democracy in India’s foreign policy needs to be explored.

Beaulieu also evokes to great effect the dilemma facing a party of democratic centralism dealing with a membership that was more than 80 per cent Finnish and Ukrainian. He sets in stark relief the trials and tribulations of attempting to ‘‘Bolshevize’’ the language associations. If the Communist Party moved too forcefully, it risked losing the majority of its membership; if it accepted the status quo, the much-needed shift of leaders and organizers from cultural pursuits to workplace organizing and political action would not take place. Labour at the Lakehead is a good read, and readers will come away from it amazed at the richness and vibrancy of the left in northwestern Ontario. Yes, it is a tale of backsliding, infighting, and epithets – my favourite is ‘‘pig headed mutts’’ – not to mention betrayal, corruption, and selling out. Yet we can only marvel at the ability of a left, in such a relatively small population, to turn out 5,000 to 6,000 workers in March 1930 to protest unemployment and imperialist war, 1,400 marchers for International Women’s Day in March 1931, and 5,000 workers in Port Arthur and Fort William demonstrating that same April. And this is just a small sample. Perhaps Beaulieu has not gotten all he could have out of this seeming contradiction, but he has left future scholars with an excellent base to work from and no excuses. He adds impetus to the need for a history of the Social Democratic Party and for works similar to Labour at the Lakehead about Sault Ste Marie and northeastern Ontario. Thanks to Labour at the Lakehead, we can now envision a day in which the history of the northern Ontario left takes its rightful place in our understanding of the Canadian past. peter campbell Queen’s University", :year 2013, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes ["Review"], :journal {:name "The Canadian Historical Review", :pages "159 - 161", :volume "94"}, :authors [{:authorId "48715711", :name "Andrew Parnaby"}]} {:paperId "73caf678e31a95343d56c3783479addc3c22c827", :title "The relationship between affective polarization and democratic backsliding: comparative evidence", :abstract "ABSTRACT Why do voters vote for undemocratic politicians in a democracy? My chief contention is that affective polarization has become a primary factor driving support for undemocratic politicians. Once partisan identification turns into a salient identity in the hierarchy of group affiliations, it has the potential to widen inter-party distances. Such a political environment fosters positive beliefs of their preferred party and negative beliefs of the other party, which promote political cynicism, intolerance and increase partisan loyalty. As a result, crossing party lines becomes costly, even when incumbents violate democratic principles or incumbents’ economic policies do not appeal to supporters’ interests. This tradeoff enables undemocratic politicians to evade electoral sanctions for undemocratic behaviour. I created an extended version of Reiljan’s affective polarization application. The new dataset covers affective polarization scores of 53 countries calculated over 170 national election surveys. I find that increasing affective polarization is highly correlated with democratic backsliding, less accountability, less freedom, fewer rights, and less deliberation in democracies.

I contend that a large productivity gap between economic groups motivates those with low productivity to capture the state for rent-seeking. They assess their relative position as weak and are willing to sacrifice certain democratic guarantees in exchange for favorable policies. Erosion takes two forms. (1) With high inter-class inequality and a large productivity gap among economic industries, losing economic elites capture the state through a political outsider who enacts favorable policy. Once in office, the outsider expands his personal executive control and attacks key democratic veto players. (2) When inter-class inequality is high but the inter-industry productivity gap is small, a united economic elite coordinate to stop a populist takeover.

This downward slide in political freedom has been the longest continuous decline in political rights and civil liberties since the watch-dog organization began measuring these trends over 40 years ago. Some of this backsliding has occurred in democratic countries like Hungary, where Prime Minister Viktor Orban publicly declared the end of liberal democracy as he continued to undermine the media, the judiciary, and other key institutional checks on executive power following his election in 2010. Or in Turkey where President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has dismantled checks on his power, censured opponents, and limited critical media, particularly in the last two years. However, a good deal of the deterioration globally has occurred within the subset of states we would consider to be non-democracies. From Egypt to Russia to Venezuela to Thailand, autocratic incumbents are expanding their control over the levers of power. Adding to the respite (and perhaps even the reversal) in the steady march toward democracy that occurred under the “Third Wave”—a term coined by Samuel P.

By the late2000s, however, the net increase in the number of democracies slowed and the tide of democratization appeared to crest. this slowdown should not be altogether surprising; as the number of democracies increased, the remaining authoritarian regimes by definition constituted tougher cases. mass mobilization against these remaining dictatorships of ten failed to produce successful democratic transitions, as the arab spring showed most clearly.2 But other developments were somewhat more sur prising. First the number of intermediate regimes— variously labeled illiberal democracies, semiauthoritarian, electoral authoritarian, or competitive authoritarian regimes3— held surprisingly constant. some of these regimes arose in the wake of transitions from “harder” authoritarian rule, most notably in the former soviet union and parts of africa. yet others reflected the failure of new democracies to consolidate. military coups have become less common over time, but we have seen an increase in what we call “backsliding” from democracy: actions on the part of nominally democratic incumbents that exploit the benefits of office— including economically— to", :year 2016, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "", :pages "1-26", :volume ""}, :authors [{:authorId "65939162", :name "Stephan Haggard"} {:authorId "49671593", :name "R.

The theoretical foundation for expecting peace to flow from democracy was set forth by Immanuel Kant. According to the interpretation in this article, Kant's notion of a pacific union of democracies rests on three pillars; first, the mere existence of democracies with their culture of peaceful resolution of conflict; second, the common moral bonds which are forged between democracies on this basis; third, the democracies' economic cooperation towards mutual advantage. The paper analyses each of the three conditions in the light of recent processes of democratization. It concludes that the emergence of a global pacific union embracing all the new and old democracries cannot be taken for granted. Success for the pacific union demands that the three basic conditions laid down by Kant are met by all members. Presently, this is far from the case. A pacific union is a reality among the industrialized democracies in the West; it may expand to include several of the new democracies in the East. Yet most of the democracies in the South fail to meet at least two of Kant's conditions, and instead of further democratic progress, they may backslide towards authoritarian rule. Finally, the article argues that it is possible to accept Kant's vision without rejecting basic insights of neorealism. The distance between Kant's idealism and neorealism is often overdone, as in Mearsheimer's analysis. A pacific union is the type of anarchy called a security community. It is only the extreme vision of Mearsheimerian neorealism with its one-sided emphasis on raw anarchy, and patterns of alliance and threat between anonymous state-units as the only sources of peace and war, which creates an insurmountable gulf between neorealism and Kantian thinking.", :year 1992, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes ["JournalArticle"], :journal {:name "Journal of Peace Research", :pages "397 - 414", :volume "29"}, :authors [{:authorId "1833432478", :name "Georg Sørensen"}]} {:paperId "7c4444619ad62e459d3dc68737fd9da45a77d905", :title "AuthPop", :abstract "Democratic backsliding is a major concern around the world, with large-scale movements engaging in anti-democratic tactics even in long-established democracies.

We argue that it does, through two mechanisms. First, in an age of elite polarization, norms have been politicized. This leads affectively polarized partisans to oppose particular constitutional protections when their party is in power but support them when their party is out of power, via a cue-taking mechanism. Second, affective polarization may generate biases that motivate voters to restrict the other party’s rights. Using nationally representative surveys, we find strong support for the cue-taking argument. In 2019, with a Republican administration in power, affectively polarized Republicans opposed constitutional protections while affectively polarized Democrats supported them. The reverse was true in 2012 during a Democratic administration. The findings have important, albeit troubling, implications for American democracy, as affective polarization undermines support for basic democratic principles.

While Americans still support democracy in the abstract, scholars have recently sounded alarm bells about the decline in support for democratic norms (Carey et al. 2019; Bartels 2020): “the ‘fundamental values’ or ‘rules of the game’ considered essential for constitutional government” (McClosky 1964, p. 362). If these norms erode, then there is a serious risk of democratic backsliding or even failure (Levitsky and Ziblatt 2018; Lieberman et al. 2019). What explains the erosion of support for these core principles? We argue that affective polarization—the tendency to view opposing partisans negatively and co-partisans positively (Iyengar and Westwood 2015, p. 691)—vitiates support for democratic norms through two mechanisms. First, elites in positions of power signal displeasure with norms limiting that power (e.g., checks and balances). This causes affectively polarized partisans to react based on whether or not their party is in power. Second, affective polarization may generate biases against the out-party that leads partisans from both parties to oppose norms requiring the fair treatment of all points of view (e.g., norms of political tolerance). We test these hypotheses with representative national surveys, and find strong support for the politicization mechanism. In 2019, with a Republican in the White House, affectively polarized Republicans opposed constitutional protections while affectively polarized Democrats supported them. The reverse was true in 2012 during a Democratic administration. Overall, the results have troubling normative implications, as individuals view foundational democratic principles as political fodder rather than as core bedrocks of our system. Democratic Norms and Affective Polarization While few scholars question the importance of democratic norms, there is less agreement about how to measure support for them. Some rely on questions that ask about the importance of living in a democracy (e.g., Norris 2011), while others ask about applications, such as whether a voter would support a candidate who violates a particular norm (e.g., Graham and Svolik 2020). The first approach is problematic due to strong social desirability biases. The second approach more closely matches the theoretical construct; however, generalization beyond the particular application can be difficult. We take a middle ground and focus on support for two broad types of democratic norms identified by earlier scholars. The first type captures people’s beliefs about constitutional protections (McClosky 1964; Levitsky and Ziblatt 2018). This entails an endorsement of separation of powers, checks and balances, and a rejection of authoritarian tendencies. The second type of 664 Kingzette et al. D ow naded rom http/academ ic.p.com /poq/artic/2/663/6373858 by N orthw etern U niersity Lrary user on 16 N ovem er 2021 norm is political tolerance, or the belief that all citizens, including adversaries, deserve equal rights (Mouffe 2000; Gutmann and Thompson 2012). This entails support for political voice and equality, even for those with whom we disagree or find objectionable. Such rights include voting, speech, and protest (Schedler and Sarsfield 2007; Carey et al. 2019). Both sets of norms should garner widespread support, reflecting their centrality to the American system of government. These norms should trump partisan considerations since they constitute the underlying coordinating mechanism that governs partisan competition (Graham and Svolik 2020) and make democracy self-reinforcing (Weingast 1997). Yet, concerns about partisan considerations have become paramount thanks to an unprecedented rise in affective polarization over the last quarter century: partisans today dislike and distrust the other party at remarkably high levels (Iyengar et al. 2019). Thus far, evidence on affective polarization affecting norms is mixed. For example, Westwood, Peterson, and Lelkes (2019) report that affectively polarized partisans are more apt to want to investigate the other party for corruption, but no more likely to endorse using tear gas on a group of protesters from the other side. Graham and Svolik (2020) find that strong partisans, in particular, prefer candidates from their own party even if they violate norms such as electoral fairness, checks and balances, and/or civil liberties. These scholars focus on whether citizens are willing to put their commitment to democratic ideals into action. Graham and Svolik (2020) find they clearly are not. Here, we step back in a more abstract direction to gauge support for core principles. If we find that citizens support even these broad principles—let alone actions to protect them—it would be particularly troubling. Additionally, we focus (in our main analyses) on affective polarization, along the lines of Lelkes and Westwood (2017), but in contrast to Graham and Svolik (2020), who look at partisan, policy, and candidate extremity. We theorize that affective polarization can influence support for democratic norms via two related mechanisms. First, especially for norms about limits on executive power, we argue that affective polarization shapes support for norms via politicization and cue-taking. Elites in power—especially the president—push against democratic norms precisely because these norms tie their hands and limit their power. The opposing party, in contrast, will support these norms, as they would prefer that the president’s power be limited (especially in the contemporary era of elite polarization). So, voters receive a clear partisan cue about whether to support such norms based on 1. As Levitsky and Ziblatt (2018) make clear, in earlier eras in American politics, party was a less clear dividing line in politics, and so this argument may not travel back in time. Our argument is designed to apply to the current era of highly polarized national (elite) politics. Affective Polarization and Democratic Norms 665 D ow naded rom http/academ ic.p.com /poq/artic/2/663/6373858 by N orthw etern U niersity Lrary user on 16 N ovem er 2021 which party controls the White House: support them when the opposing party has the presidency, but not when one’s own party does. Affective polarization heightens the power of such cues (Druckman et al. 2021). Affectively polarized partisans feel a need to signal their partisan identity, distinguishing themselves from the other party. This leads to directional motivated cognition and more partisan cue-taking (Lavine, Johnston, and Steenbergen 2012; Lelkes 2018). When a Republican is in the White House, the more affectively polarized Republican voters are, the less they will support democratic norms, particularly those concerning constitutional protections that limit executive power. For Democratic voters, however, the opposite is true: the higher their levels of affective polarization, the stronger their support for democratic norms (and sp", :year 2021, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes ["Review"], :journal {:name "Public Opinion Quarterly", :volume ""}, :authors [{:authorId "9539241", :name "Jonathon Kingzette"} {:authorId "4106384", :name "James N.

The evidence suggests that dominant parties strategically contest subnational elections to minimize potential threats to the regime, particularly focusing on cities of greater size or political importance. This allows an aspiring dominant party to strategically restrict opportunities for the opposition to build up an electoral base to challenge the regime and to better control patronage possibilities. Using an original panel dataset of Hungarian mayoral election results from 2002 to 2019, this paper analyzes subnational politics under the Fidesz party, which is consolidating a single-party dominant regime.

However, research mainly looks at the two phenomena as distinct from each other. While studies on revolutionary actions are interested in the agency and the impact of the actions on the country’s institutions, legal research focuses on the constitution itself. The separation of the two strands leads to a limited understanding of their dynamics and complexity. What do we know about the relationship between revolutionary actions and constitutional crisis, and vice versa? The first question is how revolutionary actions trigger constitutional crisis, defined as a moment in which decision makers are unwilling or unable to manage the societal conflicts within the confinement of the constitutionally provided boundaries. Different types of revolutionary behavior—such as elite-led military coups, civil wars, and nonviolent resistance movements—trigger constitutional crises in many cases. They can lead to a new constitution with diverse implications for the political system. Whether the opposition or the old regime prevails in the constitutional crisis is a question of the power resources of both parties to the conflict. In some cases, the opposition movements succeed in making the political system more democratic. However, there are also cases where the constitutional crisis ultimately leads to more power for the ruling class.\n The relationship also works vice versa: a constitutional crisis can trigger revolutionary actions. Constitutional coups, and processes of democratic backsliding and constitutional rot, can trigger violent and nonviolent revolutionary actions. Political elites can try to change constitutional norms for their own benefit, such as extending the presidential term of office. This often leads to a storm of public protest and can become a real threat to the regime’s survival. A constitution can enter a crisis phase for a long time if it no longer serves the needs of parts of society. The injustices that thus arise within society can be a strong motive for revolutions. The combination of agency and constitutional processes is a promising avenue for future research that could help analyze the complex relationship between constitutional crises and revolutionary actions.

I argue that while the movement is under threat largely due to its principled value of educating democratic citizens, it still has powerful potential and global impact; in part because LAS education is primarily an indigenous phenomenon adapting to local circumstances. I also argue that U.S. universities could contribute more constructively to the movement if they conceived of their role as global civic actors that conduct themselves in the spirit of mutuality and reciprocity, not as multinational corporations that channel neoliberal tendencies to maximize revenue. U.S. critics of the global LAS movement should also pay heed to the United States’ own history. Specifically, they can learn from historically Black colleges and universities how, operating under the extreme authoritarianism of the Jim Crow era, they managed to produce leaders who shaped a more democratic country.

The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon (2009), having ‘rescued’ parts of the Draft Treaty Establishing a Constitution for Europe, was supposed to herald a new chapter in European integration, with greater institutional stability and coherence, a consolidation of its achievements and a focus on furthering integration in areas where only limited steps had been taken. However, despite the advanced stage of European integration, the decade since Lisbon has been marked by a series of crises. Whilst the EU is certainly used to facing serious crises, dealing with them and often emerging with renewed goals and impetus, many of the recent challenges are unprecedented and go to the heart of what the EU is – and stands for. The economic and financial crises; questions over the future of the euro; the lack of collective responses to migration and regional instability; democratic and rule of law backsliding in some Member States; the UK referendum on leaving the EU and the complexities of Brexit negotiations, and more recently the challenges of coordinating the fight against the coronavirus pandemia, have dominated the debates. All bring to the fore the complex relationship between law and politics in the EU, and revive or renew discussions about the role of law and legal actors in European integration. Law has always played a central role in European integration.1 Whilst new forms of integration take shape, and modes of governance have diversified, law continues to play a primordial, yet evolving, role in EU integration and governance in general, and in addressing these multiple challenges. EU law, in any case, does not operate in a political and social vacuum. It is influenced by multiple societal forces and impacts back on them in a continually iterative process. This Research Handbook introduces and considers contemporary academic perspectives on the politics of EU law. Its object of study is the law of the EU, in its various forms and shapes, its complex and multifaceted institutional framework and system of governance, the broad spectrum of policies it covers, and its relationship with emerging forms of global law.

This gained further momentum in late 2019 with the outbreak \nof the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in Wuhan, China. In the fight against this virus, which has \nresulted in the deaths of millions of people, governments implemented several significant measures, \nincluding closures, curfews, and mandatory vaccinations. Under the pretense of combatting the virus, \npopulist politicians, who already had authoritarian inclinations before the pandemic, disregarded \nimportant democratic principles, such as free and fair elections, separation of powers, political liberties, \nand civil rights. The violations of these principles by populist leaders accelerated global democratic \nbacksliding. In this context, in March 2020, in response to the coronavirus pandemic, Hungary’s Prime \nMinister Viktor Orban, who has used every political crisis to find excuses to pursue undemocratic \npolicies and strengthen his hold on power, pushed the Hungarian parliament to grant him extraordinary \nemergency powers. He used coronavirus precautions to establish one-man rule in Hungary by \nbypassing parliament. His government devised a legislative framework to suppress critics of its policies \nin the media, civil society, and the opposition.

First, it strikes at the root of Islamist extremism, making it more difficult for terrorists to credibly claim that their faith is under attack.

Democratic failure, they argue, is not inevitable, and is not even tightly linked to the phenomenon of democratic backsliding. Wealth, in particular, remains an insulating factor that protects democracies from paying the ultimate price. In response, I have three points to make. First, the distinction between breakdown and backsliding in their account is not as sharp as it could be. This blunts some of the force of the argument. Second, I agree with the authors that erosion—rather than democratic death—is what we should be concerned about. It is easy to imagine significant erosion in the United States, beyond what we have experienced, without a full-fledged collapse.

The main concern of this article is the association between intergenerational social mobility and support for democracy in post-socialist societies. I present a theoretical framework in which individuals’ political attitudes are affected by their intergenerational social mobility experiences. I model this theoretical argument using two complementary data-sets and various multivariable and multilevel statistical techniques. The results indicate that intergenerational social mobility, particularly its subjective perception, has statistically significant links with attitudes towards democracy and that this association is moderated by the attained level of democracy in the country where an individual resides. This may suggest that studying social origins of support for democracy by means of intergenerational social mobility can be an important tool to understand the conundrum of democratisation and democratic backsliding in post-socialist societies.", :year 2020, :openAccessPdf {:url "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/03906701.2020.1776918?needAccess=true", :status "HYBRID"}, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "International Review of Sociology", :pages "376 - 396", :volume "30"}, :authors [{:authorId "49772050", :name "A.

Using a systematic analysis of all speeches, statements and interviews of the PM for his three consecutive governments 2010–2022, I claim the radicalization of this Eurosceptic discourse is a direct consequence of a continuous populist performance of crisis that demands the creation of images of friends and foes to unite and mobilize people. Orbán relies on discursive processes of othering to construct to his liking both “the good people” and its enemies, who are to be blamed for the crises. Anybody can become an enemy in the various crises that follow each other. At the same time, discursive conceptions of Europe vs. the EU remain in the center of the discourse to establish Hungary's European belonging as well as opposition to EU for policies that allegedly people reject. While the economic crisis pits an economic “us” against the former socialist political elite, foreign capital, and the EU and IMF that are all blamed for Hungary's near-bankruptcy situation. The refugee crisis redefines both “us” and “others”, the “self” is distinguished using ethno-linguistic criteria and identitarian Christianity to signal the cultural distance from the Muslim migrant “other” as well as multicultural EU. The pandemic crisis is performed only to further exacerbate the conflict between the illiberal “self” and the liberal “others”, where supranational EU, promoting multiculturalism, gender ideology or neoliberal policies not only threatens the very existence of traditional-national lifestyles but endangers the people themselves. With each crisis performed, newer and newer conflict lines between various “European self's” and “threatening EU” are identified, each adding to the radicalization of Orbán's discourse.

This article analyzes the microfoundations of faltering support for democracy through the lens of democratic backsliding in Hungary, drawing upon original survey data and a lab-in-the-field experiment to demonstrate that many citizens feel disgust towards multiparty politics, and that this causes a visceral rejection of democracy. Disgust towards political competition undermines normative commitment to the democratic system, allowing would-be autocrats to consolidate power as members of the public decline to defend a system they feel disgust towards. The data tie this disgust to a political dialogue of outrageous accusations, which elicits anger in the few citizens who hold strong partisan predispositions, but leaves the rest of the populace disgusted and less dedicated to democracy as an ideal. ∗Word count: 9,354 †Ph.D. Candidate, The Ohio State University. Email: debell.2@osu.edu On July 26, 2014, Hungary’s Prime Minister, Viktor Orbán, delivered a speech in which he declared the failure of liberal democracy, vowing to “build a new illiberal state based on national foundations.”1 Though this statement follows years of systematic assault on the institutions of liberal democracy by the Orbán government, Hungarian society met his remarks with a muted shrug. At the onset of the transition, scholars worried that democracy would fail to take root in Hungary and other transitioning states in post-communist Europe (Przeworski, 1991; Jowitt, 1992), but their concerns that a lack of popular support would undermine the new system are more warranted today, twenty-five years after the fall of the Berlin Wall. The Hungarian government has successfully restructured the country’s political institutions with a new illiberal constitution with little public outcry. Meanwhile, political participation continues to wane; turnout has fallen in every Hungarian election since 2002. Why would citizens in one of post-communist Europe’s most successful cases of democratization remain inactive in light of attacks on democracy? Why has experience with democracy failed to yield support for its ideals? The answer to these questions lies in the particular nature of citizens’ democratic experience: a never-ending stream of vitriol in which all sides accuse political rivals of outrageous violations of morality. Political elites utilize these attacks to elicit anger in order to drive political action. But, in reality, a discourse that deals primarily in documenting politicians’ immorality elicits disgust rather than anger for many citizens. While anger leads to political engagement (Brader, 2006) and may explain the widespread protest voting for unorthodox parties noted in the region (Pop-Eleches, 2010), disgust leads to disengagement from politics so thorough as to cause a withdrawal from the very ideal of democracy. The distinction between anger —– an emotion often studied by scholars of political behavior and campaign politics –— and disgust –— an emotion heretofore largely ignored in political science –— illuminates the situation in Hungary and many other faltering young democracies. 1“Egy illiberális, nemzeti alapokon álló új államot fölépı́teni.” Hungarian original text at:http://www. kormany.hu/hu/a-miniszterelnok/beszedek-publikaciok-interjuk/a-munkaalapuallam-korszaka-kovetkezik.

This upward trend, however, stopped in 2006 and has since showed signs of reversal a pattern Diamond labels as the “democratic recession.” Freedom House’s more recent 2018 Freedom in the World data supports this trend, finding that the percentage of countries rated as “free” declined from a peak of 46.6% in 2007 to 45.1% in 2017, while the proportion of “not free” countries increased from 22.3% in 2007 to 25.1% in 2017. The report also suggests that the number of countries experiencing declines in aggregate freedom scores has exceeded the number showing improvement for each of the last twelve years. An alternative measure, the Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) project’s Liberal Democracy Index (LDI), finds that while the global of democracy remains near its historical high, “more countries experienced significant democratic backsliding than improvement over the last five years,” suggesting that the level of average global democracy has receded to its levels from ten or fifteen years ago. Similarly, the Bertelsmann Stiftung’s Transformation Index (BTI) has also recorded a modest global decline on its Democracy Status measure from 2006 to 2016, while the global average on the Economist Intelligence Unit’s Democracy Index has seen overall decline from 2006 to 2017. This global shift is related to several constituent patterns: signs of deconsolidation in established democracies, the stabilization and entrenchment of fully authoritarian regimes, and the slowing of democratization and rise in backsliding among hybrid or partially democratic regimes. This article examines the latter phenomenon – that of democratic backsliding, which Lust and Waldner (2015) define as “a deterioration of qualities associated with democratic governance within any regime; it is a decline in the quality of democracy, when it occurs within democratic regimes, or in democratic qualities of governance in autocracies.”", :year 2018, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal nil, :authors [{:authorId "47970038", :name "S.

Concern that the proposed reforms would lead to a concentration of power in the executive and a weakening of the courts sparked protests throughout Israel.

The timeline of nearly thirty years has been fueled by extreme debates and harsh statements which have resulted in the division of society in two camps of public judgment-the communists and the anti-communists. The number of studies conducted on the impact of transitional justice on democratic backsliding is quite limited, and similarly, there is a paucity of research on the correlation between transitional justice and polarization within the country. Albania’s transitional justice dynamic can be better understood by contextualizing it in terms of regime change and consolidation, which would bring significant insights. The primary objective of this paper is to concentrate on the theoretical and conceptual framework of transitional justice, and to discuss its primary differences in how it deals with the past.

Key fact and findings include: • Prior to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, countries across Asia and the Pacific faced a range of democratic challenges. Chief among these were continuing political fragility, violent conflict, recurrent military interference in the political sphere, enduring hybridity, deepening autocratization, creeping ethnonationalism, advancing populist leadership, democratic backsliding, shrinking civic space, the spread of disinformation, and weakened checks and balances. The crisis conditions engendered by the pandemic risk further entrenching and/or intensifying the negative democratic trends observable in the region prior to the COVID-19 outbreak. • Across the region, governments have been using the conditions created by the pandemic to expand executive power and restrict individual rights. Aspects of democratic practice that have been significantly impacted by anti-pandemic measures include the exercise of fundamental rights (notably freedom of assembly and free speech). Some countries have also seen deepened religious polarization and discrimination. Women, vulnerable groups, and ethnic and religious minorities have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic and discriminated against in the enforcement of lockdowns. There have been disruptions of electoral processes, increased state surveillance in some countries, and increased influence of the military. This is particularly concerning in new, fragile or backsliding democracies, which risk further eroding their already fragile democratic bases. • As in other regions, however, the pandemic has also led to a range of innovations and changes in the way democratic actors, such as parliaments, political parties, electoral commissions, civil society organizations and courts, conduct their work. In a number of countries, for example, government ministries, electoral commissions, legislators, health officials and civil society have developed innovative new online tools for keeping the public informed about national efforts to combat the pandemic. And some legislatures are figuring out new ways to hold government to account in the absence of real-time parliamentary meetings. • The consideration of political regime type in debates around ways of containing the pandemic also assumes particular relevance in Asia and the Pacific, a region that houses high-performing democracies, such as New Zealand and the Republic of Korea (South Korea), a mid-range performer (Taiwan), and also non-democratic regimes, such as China, Singapore and Viet Nam—all of which have, as of December 2020, among the lowest per capita deaths from COVID-19 in the world. While these countries have all so far managed to contain the virus with fewer fatalities than in the rest of the world, the authoritarian regimes have done so at a high human rights cost, whereas the democracies have done so while adhering to democratic principles, proving that the pandemic can effectively be fought through democratic means and does not necessarily require a trade off between public health and democracy. • The massive disruption induced by the pandemic can be an unparalleled opportunity for democratic learning, change and renovation in the region. Strengthening democratic institutions and processes across the region needs to go hand in hand with curbing the pandemic. Rebuilding societies and economic structures in its aftermath will likewise require strong, sustainable and healthy democracies, capable of tackling the gargantuan challenges ahead.

The governing elites had different needs at different political stages and instrumentalized women's rights to meet those needs. First, they needed to legitimize their rule in a secular context, so they expanded liberal laws on women's rights. Second, in the process of backsliding, they sought to construct and legitimize their conservative ideology, so they reinterpreted existing laws to promote conservative goals. Finally, they wanted to mobilize conservative women in support of the newly authoritarian regime, so they built new institutions and marginalized existing women's NGOs.

The current state of the Russian debate on the Northern Dimension should be studied from the two viewpoints. First, it is the Northern Dimension as a four-lateral forum. Second, it is the Northern Dimension as a political filter. The Northern Dimension concept has created the opportunity to reject the transition discourse on Russia via replacing the approach to Russia as a country “between East and West” with the approach to the country as a part of “the North”. Introduction The Northern Dimension concept was proposed by Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev twenty years ago. Fifteen year ago, when Finland faced the challenges of EU enlargement, Finnish politicians of both ruling parties and opposition started speaking about the Northern Dimension. Ten years ago the debate on the Northern Dimension reached Russia. Five years ago most Russian agents concluded that the Northern Dimension does not meet Russia’s national interests. Today they are reconsidering it. The aim of this paper is to uncover the context, in which Russian debate on the Northern Dimension concept led to the change of the mainstream approach from negative to neutral, as well as to sketch the factors that may lead to further change of the approach to positive. Sixteen years ago then Russian President Boris Yeltsin declared that Russian is located between East and West and is moving westwards. This move westwards became popular in international relations literature under the name of transition. Seven years ago new Russian President Vladimir Putin declared that transition is over. However, Russia did not find its place in the West, neither it returned to the East. This situation created background for various scholars and foreign policy-makers to claim that transition is continuing; and that the transition does not only includes breakthroughs, but also backslides. The Northern Dimension provides Russia with an opportunity to end its trip between East and West and find its stable place in the global North. This paper consists of four sections. The first section underlines the common feature of the Russian debate on the Northern Dimension concepts on any of its stages: Russian agents have always discussed it as something just invented, despite ten years of the debate passed by. The second section describes Russian debate on the Northern Dimension concept in 1998 – 2002, when the debate was most active, but mainstream approach to the concept was generally negative. The third section uncovers the reasons, while Russian debate on the Northern Dimension concept slowed down in 2002 through 2006. The fourth section provides brief overview of the recently renewed debate on the Northern Dimension concept in Russia. Northern Dimension as a Peace Project The Northern Dimension (ND) has been first proposed by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in his Murmansk (1987) speech. Finnish proponents of ND frequently remind about that proposal in their writings (cf. Heininen, 1996: 306) in order to underline that it is not a concept that has become fashionable among social scientists for a short term, but is a concept, which has a history and consequently has been firmly established in the discourse and the practice of international relations in the North of Europe. Under “concept that has a history” I hereinafter mean a concept, an important part of the contemporary discourse on which is the belief that this concept used to be debated in the past too. The belief that a concept has a history correlates with the belief that this concept has a future too. Under “concept that has a future” I hereinafter mean a concept, an important part of the contemporary discourse on which is the belief that this concept will continue to be debated in a long run. To put it simple, what has last for long will last for long, but what has just appeared can disappear soon. Examples are Russian debates on the Russian nation, on democracy, on globalization and on the Westphalian system of international relations. Russian debate on the Russian nation does not differ much from Western debate on nationalism in general in terms that primordialists and modernists meet in the debate. Modernists insist that Russian nation emerged almost at the same time with other European nations; and an important shift to the formation of Russian nation was given by the “Patriotic”, as it is called in Russian historiography, war against French invasion in 1812. In their turn, primordialists insist that Russian nation emerged together with the Russian state in the 9 th century. Rhetoric of extreme right political parties in Russia is mostly based on the primordialist argument. For example, Alexander Solzhenitsyn’s widely criticized book “Two Centuries Together” (2001) on Russian – Jewish relations in the Russian Empire and later in the Soviet Union is at the same time widely quoted in the arguments of Russian extreme nationalists. The book approaches the relations between Russian and Jewish ethnic groups through the past two hundred years like the groups had transformed into nations before the story began, rejecting nation-building process that both groups underwent during that time. Consequently, the book provides the ground for extreme nationalists’ beliefs in the supremacy of “thousand-year-old” Russian nation facing, for example, Estonians, whose nation, from the point of view of the extreme nationalists, was created together with the Estonian state in the early 20 th century. The debate on the Westphalian system is closely interconnected with the debate on nationalism. The very name “Westphalian” is a declaration that the system of international relations consisting of nation-states has existed since the Treaty of Westphalia was signed in mid-17 th century. Thus, scholars, who continue approaching states as major, if not only, actors in international relations, claim that the Westphalian system has existed for over three centuries and, consequently, will exist for at least as long as that. Some of them go further and declare that its roots go deep into history of Hundred Years War. To the contrary, scholars, who declare the rising importance of non-state actors and approach the Westphalian system as disappearing, tend to locate its birth time in history as close to the present as possible: to the times of the French Revolution and even to the times of German and Italian unification (Ouellet, 2004). Globalization, which has become a popular concept in international relations literature no longer ago than 1990s, was among rare concepts that Russian international relations scholars did not adopted Western approaches to, but globalization was a concept that Russian and Western scholars debated on together. Most Russian scholars agree that globalization concept challenges the concept of the Westphalian state system, bringing new actors and new global challenges, like those of the environment, to the agenda of international studies. At the same time, Russian proponents of globalization concept often use the same argument to prove that globalization is an important issue in international relations: the historic argument. Above it has been described how proponents of the Westphalian approach to international studies prove that the Westphalian system is a concept that has a history. Proponents of globalization in Russia do the same. Some of them mention in their writings that globalization as a concept was used by American journalists already in the early 20 th century (cf. Achkasov & Lantsov, 2002: 103). Others notice that globalization as a concept was used in other disciplines than social sciences already in 1960 (cf. Lebedeva, 2004: 99). There is no common opinion on the relationship between globalization and democracy; Russian scholars tend to avoid raising that issue at all. Proponents of globalization claim that it affects democratization positively (cf. Bhagwati, 2004: 92 – 105); opponents of it, especially among leftist non-governmental organizations, insist that transnational corporations support corrupt political regimes in the Third World. Regardless of the effect that globalization poses on democratization; Russian debate on democracy is another example of the belief that concepts having a history have a future too. And, consequently, the future of a concept that does not have a history in the discourse of some country will be troublesome as well. Namely, an important part of Russian debate on democracy is the belief that the country’s difficulties in democratization are rooted in the fact that the country does not have experience of democratic governance comparable to that of Western European countries. That belief used to be (and still is) so popular in Russia and other post-Communist countries in the early 1990s that critique of this thesis found a place in Fukuyama’s (1993: 69) “End of History”. Similarly to other cases, proponents of ND claim that this concept has a long history, while opponents of it avoid noticing earlier mentions of it. Above it was noticed that Finnish proponents of ND underline its roots going back into Gorbachev’s speech. Russian scholars in general frequently underline concepts that have been created by Russians; however, in the case of ND they very seldom notice that ND was first proposed by a Russian. That observation illustrates and simultaneously explains the generally suspicious relation to ND concept by participants of corresponding Russian debate. Another explanation of the suspicion that dominated Russian debate on ND is the difficulty of definition of it in terms of practice of Russian political discourse. Russian debate on ND entered its active phase in 1998 after Rovaniemi (1997) speech by Finnish Prime", :year 2007, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes ["Review"], :journal nil, :authors [{:authorId "2081961082", :name "D.

In other words, Western democracies can cope more successfully with various attacks on their liberal institutions because their courts, media, human rights organizations, and ombudsmen have a longer and better-developed tradition of independence and professionalism. Conversely, where such institutions are weak and underdeveloped, as is the case in CEE, there is always the potential danger of a drift towards authoritarianism and “illiberal democracy.” As examples from Hungary and Slovenia show, even the most advanced CEE democracies are not immune to this backsliding.

This has resulted in the global shrinking of civic space for civil society organizations (CSOs). NGOs engaging in advocacy activities are seen to be among the CSOs affected. Using four NGOs cases from Tanzania, the study contributes to the civic space debate by uncovering how advocacy NGOs become resilient.Design/methodology/approachThe study is anchored in interpretivism and a cross-sectional case study design, following a qualitative approach path. Data were collected through interviews and a documentary review.FindingsResults show that several strategies such as complying, building community back-up, collaboration, strategic litigation, using digital media and changing the scope are applied. However, strategies face obstacles including scope limitations, expected democratic roles, high cost, changes in the scope and being outsmarted by the government, and hence their effectiveness is questionable.Research limitations/implicationsThis study focused on advocacy NGOs. More studies can be conducted for other advocacy-related CSOs on how they become resilient.Practical implicationsWhile NGOs are allowed to exist in the country, their freedom continue to be curtailed. Even the effectiveness of resiliency becomes temporary and depends on the political will of the existing regime.Originality/valueTanzania NGOs have to build strong bonds with citizens, expand the scope of strategies and use deliberative democratic principles to educate the government to change laws and tolerate plural political culture.

There has been debates about whether the pandemic has led to the backsliding of democratic standards and the promotion of illiberal and authoritarian practices. This study conducted a survey in Hong Kong, a non-democracy. At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, the government postponed an election widely expected to be won by the opposition. This study explores whether health experts’ opinions could affect public support for postponement of a regular election and government trustworthiness. It finds that neither health experts’ affirmation nor negation increased support for the postponement, but rejecting the government mandate reduced government trustworthiness while affirming it did not. The negative opinions thus had asymmetric information value against affirmative opinions in a known-censored environment. This channel operates through democrats in Hong Kong, who are critical citizens of the regime. The strategy of silencing dissent would be cost-effective for preserving political trust while engaging experts to support the mandates appeared unhelpful.

The major trend of declining turnout has of course been noted, given rise to the concern that the initial boundless enthusiasm and optimism of newly unshackled voters gave way to a listless resignation after several election cycles. In essence, once hopeful electorates, faced with rising economic hardships, unresponsive elites, and democratic backsliding, simply tune out. We propose an alternate possibility, however. Post-communist elections involve critical decisions about salient issues, but not uniformly across all countries at all times. We find, in reflection of this fact, that post-communist voters are more likely to participate in greater numbers in elections that are more “important” As noted in the title of our paper, we believe this suggests a “surprisingly rational” post-communist electorate that votes more when the stakes are higher. We test this argument with a pooled cross-national time series of 135 elections from twenty-one postcommunist elections from 1990 to 2004.

A Comparative Study of Democracy under the Virus Threat", :abstract "The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has threatened socio-economic security on a global scale. Democracy has been put to the test by the spread of COVID-19, with two main arguments having arisen: 1) COVID-19 is contributing to a trend of democratic backsliding; 2) states with illiberal practices are better at handling the outbreak than are states with liberal practices. This paper answers these two arguments. In the first section, using data from various sources, this paper examines three trends to counter the democratic backslide argument: the maintenance of democracy, fallen democracy, and autocracy. The paper shows that COVID-19 has contributed very little to the decline of democracy and, in actuality, democratic backslide that occurred in 2020 happened due to factors that existed even before the outbreak—COVID-19 was merely a reflector or trigger point for states struggling with democracy. In the second section, this paper argues that states with autocratic practices may be able to contain the spread of the pandemic, but in comparison with democratic states, they are unable to manage the pandemic crisis, resulting in a larger death rate and economic decline.

After AKP’s second electoral victory in 2007, political trials, property transfers, and dismissals wrapped in a discourse of punishment and purge of the “nation’s enemies” destabilized long established power hierarchies of secularists, religious-conservatives, Kurds, and leftists in Turkey. The destabilization was caused by the state’s changing attitude toward these identity groups, and in the media it lead to shifts in journalists’ status positions and emotions. Varying professional responses triggered by these shifts explain the convergence to a dominant singular political narrative in the media. This argument builds on narrative evidence collected between 2012 and 2014 via in-depth interviews, newspaper articles, and journalists’ memoires. With a from-below account, the article presents the effects of destabilized hierarchies on journalistic practice.

Much of the scholarship has centred on states and international organisations as the primary entities responsible for protecting the rule of law. By contrast, the relationship between individuals and groups of people in civil society vis-à-vis the rule of law is under-explored in (international) law. This special issue is therefore dedicated to elaborating upon this relationship – the ‘rule of law from below.’ This Introduction sets out the concept and illustrates it with examples of the innovative ways that people are using in practice to support the rule of law from below. While noting that the concept of ‘rule of law from below’ is one under development, we argue that there is much value in investigating instances where actors beyond formal state institutions, who have no constitutional or other formal legal role, take it upon themselves to uphold and defend the rule of law.

In Nigeria in particular religion has always been a determinant factor in the electoral processes against the laws of the land. This becomes more prominent during the 4th republic (1999-date). Political actors, especially elected officers of the nation have often brought religion into governance basing their performance or lack of it on God. The term “Insha Allah” in Islam literarily mean” by the power (grace) of Allah (God). This implies that all things shall be done with the power, grace and approval of God. This coming from the leader of a secular State justifies the role of religion in politics and governance of the nation. The critical issue of the rule of law has confronted this current government under President Muhammad Buhari especially with the continued detention of the former National Security Adviser (NSA) Dasuki, who is been tried for corruption, in spite of various courts’ rulings that he should be released on bail. This is contrary to any known law(s) of the country. The question therefore arose; Are the leaders of the ruling party All Progressive Congress (APC) ruling according to the laws of the land? Can the power, grace and approval of God be the basis for abuse of the rule of law as in the case of the former NSA? This paper seeks to examine the reality of the interaction between religion and politics in a secular society like Nigeria with regards to the rule of law. The paper adopts historical and critical analysis in pursuance of the thesis that religion have often been used by political elites in Nigeria to “deceive” the electorates and deny people their right to rule of law in governance. Elizabeth Sperber: Relations Among God’s Elect(ed): How, why and when African ruling parties attempt to spur the growth and politicization of Born Again Christianity providers? Abstract: This paper draws on original data collected from African religious and political institutions between 2011-2017 to argue that the region’s ruling parties have played significant, yet understudied roles in facilitating the growth and, to varying degrees, politicization of Pentecostal and Charismatic Christianity – the fastest growing religious groups in sub-Saharan Africa (Pew 2010). Focusing on the post-Cold War period, I argue political conditions have often incentivized ruling parties to engage in “politicized propagation” of new religious movements, using public resources, political appointments, and other mechanisms to confer status upon supportive and relatively new churches and their leadership. Specifically, I enlist cross national data from over 30 African countries in addition to qualitative and subnational research, and find that in African states where the older established churches (e.g., Catholic and mainline Protestant churches) helped lead transitions to multipartiism, ruling parties typically faced increased political competition and credible Christian “watchdogs” capable of mobilizing opposition. Under these domestic political conditions, ruling parties often allocated public resources (e.g., cash, land plots, television licenses, and even media production subsidies) to newer, locally-run Pentecostal churches, while they simultaneously attempted to withhold resources from the “watchdog” churches. Zambia’s strongly pro-democratic Catholic Church, for example, was repeatedly denied a television license by governments that actively subsidized Born Again Christian television. This is not to argue that domestic politics explain all growth of Born Again Christianity, but to note that in addition to commonly cited factors for the growth of African Pentecostalism and Charismatic Christianity, such as “glocalization,” socioeconomic crises, and ideological and spiritual appeal, domestic politics have systematically influenced the relative size and public roles that these actors embrace in African states. I conclude by addressing how This paper draws on original data collected from African religious and political institutions between 2011-2017 to argue that the region’s ruling parties have played significant, yet understudied roles in facilitating the growth and, to varying degrees, politicization of Pentecostal and Charismatic Christianity – the fastest growing religious groups in sub-Saharan Africa (Pew 2010).

Faith Kabata: Religion and international human rights in Kenya’s constitution making process and the Kenya Constitution, 2010 Abstract: The paper will explore the relationship between religion and international human rights. Scholarship on religion and human rights has focused on the nature and scope of the right to religious freedom, conscience and belief and the incompatibility of religion with human rights. Even then, debate on the relationship between religion and human rights remains unsettled. There exists a gap in scholarship on the instrumental function that religion performs in uniting and mobilizing people against internationally recognized human rights. Kenya’s protracted constitution making process highlighted the relationship between religion and human rights. Throughout the process, religion was invoked and religious groups united and mobilized to contest constitutional guarantees such as the right to abortion, equality and protection of religious and sexual minorities. Despite a political settlement between the government and religious groups to ensure a ‘yes’ vote in the national referendum on the draft constitution, religious opposition to certain constitutional guarantees led to a 33% ‘no’ vote proving the instrumental function of religion in human rights. The paper will trace the 1997-2010 constitution making process in Kenya in regard to the constitutional arrangements on religion and religious freedom and the debates and considerations that informed drafting of constitutional provisions. Postpromulgation of the Constitution 2010, the paper will examine the practical application of the provisions, the continuing religious contestations on abortion, protection of sexual and non-religious minorities’ rights and equality and the courts’ interpretation. Scholarship suggests that given the centrality of human dignity to both the religious and secular perspectives on human rights, human dignity can be invoked to resolve the existing tension between human rights and religion. Notably, human dignity is the motivating principle in the Kenyan Bill of Rights. This paper will discuss how human dignity could be invoked for constitutional arrangements on religion and guarantees on religious freedom to support protection of human rights.

The time series nature of our data allows scholars to measure key characteristics of states’ dealing with their past and complements existing transitional justice datasets by focusing not only on post-conflict societies and not only on post-authoritarian societies, but on both. To showcase the possibilities our data affords scholars, we use it to develop three novel measures of personnel transitional justice: severity, urgency, and volatility.

Yet, with few exceptions, constitutional theory has failed to turn its attention to this crucial trend. In particular, the burgeoning constitutional literature aimed at addressing phenomena such as democratic backsliding, constitutional retrogression, and populist threats to judicial independence and the rule of law has failed to respond to the significance of place as an emerging cleavage in contemporary politics. An alarming disconnect has emerged between constitutionalism's overwhelmingly statist (or Westphalian) outlook and the reality of geographically localized concentration of worldviews, policy preferences, and political identities.

These events go beyond ordinary changes or even individual crises, cumulatively fuelling a “new normal” of turbulence for the EU, encompassing rapid, unpredictable changes. This turbulence can help and hinder policy design and implementation, requiring policy actors to think outside the box and beyond the status quo. This article investigates how the European Commission and other key actors can engage effectively with turbulence to ensure the successful delivery and implementation of the EGD. The first half of the article strengthens and adapts turbulent governance literature (Ansell & Trondal, 2018).

The second half undertakes an initial analysis of the EGD in light of turbulence and provides a springboard for further investigations within this thematic issue and beyond.

We challenge this gridlock by offering a theoretical and methodological framework to account for conflicting findings and to facilitate resolving this debate. Our approach combines ideas on how different levels of schooling, ways of accounting for different contexts, and epistemic community influences can affect the relationship between education and political regime. To examine these ideas, we leverage statistical meta-analysis of synthesized empirical evidence base. Contrary to mainstream views, we find that, while the overall education-political regime relationship is positive, it is small and contingent. Pro-democratic effects of education come mostly from primary schooling and are uncertain beyond this level. Country-specific factors may explain part, though not all cross-national variation.

Despite these actions conflicting with the interests and objectives of many foreign donors, this proliferation has been especially dramatic in aid-receiving countries. How do donors respond to these attacks, and do their responses vary according to how they prioritize support for advocacy work? On one hand, advocacy-oriented donors may push back by increasing funding to projects that support advocacy relative to other donors. Alternatively, advocacy-oriented donors may back down by disproportionately decreasing support for advocacy as it becomes more difficult to work with local partners. We test these arguments using dyadic data on aid flows, original global data tracking the enactment of restrictive NGOs laws, and a variety of research designs including two-way fixed effects event study models, synthetic control analysis, and placebo tests.

The interim Peruvian government that replaced the Fujimori dictatorship was its original and most energetic promoter. How accurately has the Charter captured the lessons from Peru? Does the Charter fulfill Peru's current requirements in terms of strengthening democracy? Broadly speaking, this article finds that the Charter did indeed successfully enshrine the insights learned the hard way from both OAS debacle and achievement in Peru. The Charter represents a necessary juridical systematization of the assortment of principles, norms, mechanisms, and tools built up previously in a largely ad hoc fashion. The Charter effectively filled a serious gap in defending democracy in terms of providing a mechanism for responding to non‐coup d'état situations of authoritarian backsliding by elected incumbent governments. It also fused international norms of democracy and human rights by making democracy a human right, thereby strengthening domestic and international obligations to defend and promote democracy. Nevertheless, the Charter's provisions for strengthening democracy beyond an interruption or alteration in the democratic order are relatively weak. As Peru's democratic consolidation challenges illustrate, the next step in the evolution of the OAS Democratic Solidarity Paradigm, with the admirable Inter‐American Democratic Charter as its centre piece, is to define the role of the OAS, build its resources, and strengthen its capacity for assisting member states with a whole range of post‐crisis problems, including national reconciliation, strengthening political parties and civil society, and civilian supremacy over the military.", :year 2003, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "Canadian Foreign Policy Journal", :pages "61 - 73", :volume "10"}, :authors [{:authorId "1888037", :name "T.

While the period of the 1990s might be distinguished by extensive optimism, in the 2000s we can observe a distinct change towards a more restrained perception. Furthermore, the last decade might be evaluated as pessimistic in the social sciences on the grounds of economic recession after 2008 as well other crisis in an economic, societal and political senses. The rather distinctive terms used for the expression of doubts about the pro-democratic development and consolidation, such as ‘semi-consolidated’, ‘new’ or ‘young’ democracy, or de-democratisation, were replaced with more dramatic expressions such as illiberal democracy, democratic backsliding, hybrid, regime, soft dictatorship and ‘the light that failed’, as Krastev described the recent image of East-Central Europe in an almost dystopic manner. While in the 1990s the Slovak version of democratura – Mečiarism – was perceived as the exception, in the late 2010s populist neo-illiberal regimes became the dominant shape of regimes in (East)Central Europe.

Among others, the surging influence of populist movements in Europe in the aftermath of the 2015 migration crisis has drawn considerable attention from both scholarly and practical perspectives. The looming decay of Europe’s democratic order is considered particularly worrisome, given that European postwar democracy has long been considered to be firmly consolidated. Numerous studies of comparative politics have also shown that well-off advanced democracies are rarely vulnerable to authoritarian backsliding thanks to several self-reinforcing mechanisms associated with the democratic rules of political competition and the growth of democratic political culture and involving economic development. Against this backdrop of strong belief in the resilience of advanced liberal democracy, the recent phenomenon of the rise of far-right political parties – on a global level in general and across Europe in particular – raises the fundamental question of whether today’s liberal democracy is in serious crisis. By engaging with one of the leading political theorists Jan-Werner Müller’s recent studies on the intellectual (and political) history of democracy and populism, this essay will first discuss why it is important to revisit the contested history of twentieth-century European democracy as a way to improve our understanding of populism’s contemporary rise and then discuss how Müller’s perspective can help us develop a new vision of liberal democracy in response to the challenges from right-wing populism. Jan-Werner Müller’s latest book, What is Populism? (2016), draws huge attention in tandem with the rise of populism in Europe and the United States. Since its publication, the book has been translated into more than 24 languages, including Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, and it has become one of the core references in the study of populism. Compared to his previous book Contesting Democracy (2011), What is Populism is much thinner and easier to read, as it is written for a wider audience. Conversely, Contesting Democracy is more of a scholarly book that addresses a complicated conceptual history of democracy concerning the diverse (and competing) versions – from liberal to totalitarian – of ‘popular sovereignty’ that prevailed in twentieth-century Europe.", :year 2019, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal nil, :authors [{:authorId "2110188871", :name "Min-Hyeok Kim"}]} {:paperId "911bae2fbd92e66592a30fd765956914cab7ee17", :title "The U.S. Supreme Court and Democratic Backsliding", :abstract nil, :year 2022, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "SSRN Electronic Journal"}, :authors [{:authorId "33486965", :name "Thomas M.

We investigate the ecological correlates of these outcomes across 343 Egyptian electoral districts in presidential elections before (2012) and after (2014) the 2013 military coup. We find that districts that supported the winner in democratic elections were systematically more likely to feature higher abstention, spoilage, and opposition voting in post-backslide elections. Districts with higher numbers of public employees featured lower abstention but higher spoilage rates, which we interpret as consistent with arguments that it is easier for patronage machines to monitor turnout rather than vote choice. We also find that rates of abstention, spoilage, and opposition voting were highly correlated across both elections, which potentially indicates a consistency of behaviors regardless of whether or not elections are free and fair. ∗In author order: Postdoctoral research fellow, Middle East Initiative at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, Harvard Kennedy School of Government.

Such a campaign, while often successful in the push for quotas to ensure women’s political representation in government, oversimplifies what inclusion can achieve for women. While equal rights for all citizens are central to democratic governance, “the idea that a democracy should include women in government has shifted in recent years and is now more commonly referenced as its transformed if/then version” (Valdini 2019, 47): if more women are included in the policy-making process, then both that process and its outcome will be better and more democratic. However, this expectation has not come to pass. Indeed, increases in women’s political representation have coincided with global democratic backsliding.1 This review brings together two recently published books that explore the context and contours of institutional designs for increasing women’s presence in elected office.

From the protests over the extradition law to the protests over the National Security Law, these protests are a response to the ever-encroaching hand of Beijing on political rights in Hong Kong. After the National Security Law was implemented, Hong Kong’s freedom was almost gone. One by one, pro-democracy protesters, opposition parliament members, and opposition media are being targeted and repressed. Despite the numerous protests and riots, the Hong Kong SAR government perseveres with little concession to the protesters. Why does the government of Hong Kong decided not to respect Hong Kong’s unique democratic system in China, arguably the system that has brought Hong Kong to one of the most prominent cities in the world for global interactions, and instead wish to turn it into another normal Chinese city? Why does the Hong Kong SAR government almost completely ignore the voice of the Hong Kong people? Using the framework developed by Bruce Bueno de Mesquita and Alastair Smith in The Dictator’s Handbook, I argue that the small size of Hong Kong’s governing coalition (i.e., the minimum amount of support required for the leader to stay in power) and the ease in which the Chief Executive of Hong Kong rewards her allies play a significant role in this democratic backsliding. Furthermore, while the Western World reacted in outrage over this undemocratic encroachment of Beijing on Hong Kong, I argue that their sanctions on Hong Kong leaders will not play a significant role as the Chief Executive of Hong Kong does not need their support. \nKeywords: Hong Kong; democracy; protests; governing coalition;sanctions\nREFERENCES\n \nAllison, Graham.

Such transformative power has not been replicated in the case of Western Balkan countries. Since 2003, when the EU leaders promised the European future to Western Balkan countries, save Croatia, which joined in 2013, other Western Balkan countries are backsliding on the rule of law, media freedoms, and democratic accountability. State capture and the growth of corrupt patronage networks are becoming more present in the society. Recently, with the legislative measures to prevent COVID-19, the Western Balkan countries are becoming more authoritarian. The paper argues that lack of EU to become a ‘transformative power’ in the Western Balkan countries hinders the risk of this region to return to authoritarianism and opens the ‘Pandora box’ for non-EU actors to advance their agenda, which impede NATO expansion and the EU enlargement. Therefore, the current enlargement strategy should be revised to address problems faced by Western Balkan countries and most importantly, EU Member States should not politicize enlargement process by exerting their veto power during accession process.

A key factor limiting the EU’s democratizing impact are domestic costs of complying with the EU’s conditionality: the more governments rely on illiberal and undemocratic means to maintain power, the less influence the EU has. Moreover, even if the domestic adjustment costs are not prohibitively high, for EU conditionality to bring about, or lock in democratic change, the positive and negative incentives relating to the benefits of EU membership have to be credible.

LDC was presented as not only asserting a claim to superior normative validity – undergirded by human rights, democracy and the rule of law – but also a claim to inevitability as a mode of governance. In the words of perhaps the most (in)famous articulation of this hopeful claim from its heady heyday, ‘there is now no ideology with pretentions to universality that is in a position to challenge liberal democracy’, which stands as ‘the single universal standard’.1 While this sense of inevitably had its sceptics even at LDC’s zenith,2 for a time its continued spread and ultimate triumph were not only a defensible prediction of the future, but plausibly the most convincing one. Twenty-odd years later, LDC has not only failed to become a universal mode of political organization, but its traditional bastions have themselves suffered democratic backsliding. For the past decade, the most salient form of this has been internal crisis.3 As we observed following Trump, Brexit, and a general resurgence of far-right parties across the diverse polities, ‘far right populist authoritarianism’ poses an immediate threat to LDC.4 Yet, a year after Trump’s defeat andwith the EUhaving survived Brexit in part because states central to its integrity, such as France, have – so far – resisted far right populist leadership, the norms of constitutionalism have shown a measure of robustness.5 The possibility that LDCmight", :year 2022, :openAccessPdf {:url "https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/7F1F1A248D712EFA40E812E902B8A3FF/S2045381722000028a.pdf/div-class-title-the-pendulum-swings-back-new-authoritarian-threats-to-liberal-democratic-constitutionalism-div.pdf", :status "BRONZE"}, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "Global Constitutionalism", :pages "1 - 8", :volume "11"}, :authors [{:authorId "108291655", :name "Jacob Eisler"} {:authorId "113184908", :name "Jonathan Havercroft"} {:authorId "145665924", :name "J.

During the third wave democratization, the fall of the Soviet Union and other despotic regimes in Latin America led to the gradual “autocratization” of many of these countries in the late 1990s and early 2000s. More recently, in 2011, the collapse of several authoritarian regimes in the Middle East and North African (MENA) region underscored important aspects of democratization, a process in which both women and new media technologies played a key role. However, the direct aftermath of the Arab Spring also revealed a significant democratic backsliding with the outbreak of civil and tribal wars in the region, the rise of political Islam to power, and the resulting backlash against women’s socio-political and legal rights. Drawing on Huntington’s theory of “reverse democracy”, I question whether, and to what extent, the Arab Spring could constitute a case of “fourth wave democracy”—especially considering that this most recent wave has been little, if not at all, explored and analysed. To do so, I adopt a feminist perspective that foregrounds the role of gender as the primary focus of my analysis to examine how the Arab Spring exemplified aspects of a “reverse democracy”, namely in terms of its impact on women’s rights and their resulting social status in the aftermath of the uprisings.

Andrea Krizsán and Conny Roggeband’s book stands out because it approaches the backlash against the Istanbul Convention as a threat to democracy through a comparative study of four countries in the Central and Eastern European region (CEE): Croatia, Poland, Bulgaria, and Hungary. Politicizing Gender and Democracy in the Context of the Istanbul Convention demonstrates with convincing arguments that the Istanbul Convention has become a key site for studying contemporary anti-gender movements. Its comparative approach to national cases brings new and important insights to a phenomenon that represents global trends. This book contributes to the field by engaging with several debates that are undeniably relevant to gender and politics. While gender and politics scholars previously focused on theorizing the expansion and politicization of gender equality norms, they now also focus on the processes responsible for their stagnation and regression. Various academic publications have warned against the dangers of antigender trends, which are particularly alarming for democracy. In this book, the authors posit that because anti-gender attacks are core to democratic erosion, the status of democracy must be assessed using concepts that are sensitive to gender-equal democracies. This book is a valuable contribution as it contextualizes anti-gender politics with local examples of policy backsliding and dismantling in the CEE. Further, the book makes explicit the similarities and differences among the anti-gender movements in the four countries under analysis. For instance, the well-known rhetoric of “gender ideology”—used extensively by anti-gender actors to define the Istanbul Convention “as a tool to promote ‘gender ideology’ and foreign imposition of norms” (v)—takes different shapes in the four countries (see Chapter 3).

Early evaluation work reported generally positive effects, though recent work has been more skeptical, with some studies reporting negative impacts of civic education on political engagement through highlighting the poor performance of incumbents and ongoing political processes. In this article, we report the results of a field experiment using an encouragement design to assess the Voter Opinion and Involvement through Civic Education (VOICE) programme conducted in 2010-2011 in the Democratic Republic of Congo. We adapt Bratton and Mattes’ (2007) “supply and demand” model of democratic support to the case of civic education, and derive hypotheses regarding expected impacts of VOICE on a series of democratic orientations and political participation. The results show that the VOICE programme had negative effects on support for the decentralization process and on individuals’ satisfaction with democracy in the DRC, and positive effects on non-electoral participation as well as on democratic orientations such as knowledge, efficacy, and political tolerance. We suggest that this pattern of effects has positive normative implications, and that civic education programmes continue to have the potential to deepen democratic engagement and values, even in fragile or backsliding democratic settings.", :year 2020, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "Democratization", :pages "970 - 991", :volume "28"}, :authors [{:authorId "3222455", :name "S.

Why is it that today’s language of politics is dominated and shaped by the right, at least in Poland and Hungary? What is puzzling is the reappearance of the old fascist symbols, the reconstruction of prewar nationalisms, racism, anti-Semitism, and the sense of victimhood and resentment. I am sure there are many reasons for this revival, but I would like to address only two of them.

The second reason and the following part of my analysis will deal with the “europe” element of the slogan and the Western economic crisis of 2007–2008, which put into question the link between Western democracy and economic well-being.

This double issue was produced during a global pandemic that has triggered a deep economic crisis and an unprecedented public health emergency worldwide. When we were approached to co-edit this issue, we thought the focus on feminist protest and politics could not be more timely. The multiple and interconnected crises we are living through have adversely impacted women’s, trans and non-binary people’s rights, and gender equality gains made in policy, discourse and practice. We were keen to explore the rapidly evolving terrain of gender justice and feminist organising, and identify where the new energies within feminism were located, and what may be the ways forward for building a feminist future. Our lives are overshadowed by a man-made climate crisis, and the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting millions and decimating livelihoods and economies. Violent conflicts have become more prolonged, and reflect an unequal global economic and political order that sustains proxy wars with sophisticated technology that allows warfare to be fought remotely, with limited casualties to aggressors. All the while, countries in the global North which benefit from these military interventions and conflicts for natural resource extraction are strengthening anti-immigration laws and heightening border control measures to keep refugees and migrants out. These laws are accompanied by extremist discourses that mobilise Islamophobia and different forms of religious fundamentalisms that rely on conservative interpretations of gender, race and class to define citizenship and belonging. The issues that animate contemporary feminist and gender justice struggles are diverse. In the last decade, new challenges to feminist organising have emerged. These include the rise of conservative populist forces that have co-opted feminist agendas and brought together a diverse set of actors to dismantle gender equality gains. This rise is accompanied by democratic backsliding, and growth in authoritarianism, racism and xenophobia and austerity in many countries. These trends have led governments to increasingly limit freedom of speech and expression, association, and freedom of peaceful assembly.

To investigate the role of the public in democratic backsliding, I develop a conceptual framework that differentiates among three mechanisms: vote switching, backlash, and disengagement. The first mechanism entails defection by voters from a candidate who undermines democracy to one who does not; the latter two mechanisms entail transitions between voting and abstention. I estimate the magnitude of each mechanism by combining evidence from a series of original survey experiments, traditional surveys, and a quasi-experiment afforded by the rerun of the 2019 Istanbul mayoral election, in which the governing party, akp, attempted to overturn the result of an election that it had lost. I find that although vote switching and backlash contributed to the akp's eventual defeat the most, each of the three mechanisms served as a democratic check in some subset of the Istanbul electorate.

EU intervention will typically invite the accused government to play the blame game on Brussels. By criticizing the EU for illegitimately interfering with domestic affairs, the government may frame EU intervention as a threat from the outside and present itself as the only safeguard against this threat. As a consequence, support for those domestic actors that were supposed to be weakened by EU intervention is likely to increase in the aftermath of a European intervention, while EU support might significantly drop. The article illustrates this argument by tracing domestic reactions to EU interventions against Austria between 2000 and 2002 and against Hungary since 2010. In conclusion, the EU should be very cautious with such external interventions, since they may easily strengthen anti-EU and illiberal political forces at the domestic level. To minimize the risk of such undesired consequences, bottom–up mechanisms against democratic backsliding should be installed, which would allow disadvantaged domestic groups to appeal to an independent European democracy watchdog if they feel that democratic rules are being violated in their country.", :year 2017, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "Journal of European Public Policy", :pages "352 - 365", :volume "24"}, :authors [{:authorId "113727299", :name "Bernd Schlipphak"} {:authorId "52140984", :name "Oliver Treib"}]} {:paperId "971169739dc5768be37db7d3f6bce025a5f26674", :title "Carl Schmitt and Democratic Backsliding", :abstract nil, :year 2023, :openAccessPdf {:url "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1057/s41296-023-00625-5.pdf", :status "HYBRID"}, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "Contemporary Political Theory", :pages "1 - 32"}, :authors [{:authorId "94411292", :name "I.

This article examines the complex relationship and causal direction between democracy and polarization and posits three theoretical possibilities: (1) polarization contributes to democratic backsliding and decay, (2) polarization results from democratic crisis, and (3) polarization contributes to democratic deepening. We argue “politics” is central to polarization and identify as a key feature of the process of polarization the manner in which it simplifies the normal complexity of politics and social relations. Polarization does so by aligning otherwise unrelated divisions, emasculating cross-cutting cleavages, and dividing society and politics into two separate, opposing, and unyielding blocks. As such, it often has pernicious consequences for democracy, emerging as an intended or unintended consequence of political interest–based and purposeful political mobilization. Polarization over the very concept of democracy may also be the product of democratic crisis. Finally, in certain circumstances, polarization may strengthen democratic institutions and citizen choice.

This paper explains how Venezuelan leaders used electoral manipulation in regional elections, targeted punishment of subnational authorities, and creation of parallel subnational political-administrative bodies to undermine democracy and aid in the consolidation of authoritarianism in the 2010s. During the presidency of Hugo Chávez, the government sought to win elections under relatively free conditions but pursued highly partisan attacks on opposition governors and mayors, limiting their autonomy and authority, while centralizing power. Then, as the Nicolás Maduro government faced threats to its hegemony at the ballot box, electoral manipulation gave way to outright fraud.

To this end, democratic backsliding is conceptualized in a different manner compared to conventional understandings. By doing so, the article highlights a missing aspect in the research on democratic backsliding that concerns how well-intended reforms designed to strengthen democratic institutions can also harbor non-democratic consequences. In Sweden, a new political arena was created when the former county councils were transformed into so-called called regions in 2019. As part of this, the regions have been assigned responsibility for both health care and regional development planning. The overall research problem to be analyzed in this article focuses on the relations between the policy objectives for democracy and regionalist ideas of economic growth that both were central concerns in the reform processes. The results highlight how the governing rationalities in the regional reform processes have changed during the period between 1990 and 2020. The original conception of creating a mini-version of a liberal and representative democracy have turned into a form of democratic backsliding privileging economic goals. The economic rationalities that permeate the political sphere today close the space for articulated different interests and opinions-a dimension that we argue is crucial for any democratic society. We draw two main conclusions: First that the neoliberal aspect of governing is missing in the analysis of democracy at the regional level, resulting in a descriptive discussion of democracy that tend to ignore the effects of the particularly strong emphasis on economic growth. Secondly, that there is a lack of a discussion on democracy that takes the regional level into account, i.e., that the sub-national level should be regarded and thus discussed as a distinctive level of democracy.", :year 2021, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:volume "3"}, :authors [{:authorId "116188857", :name "J.

While ASEAN has thus largely failed to become more inclusive, democracy promotion policies of the grouping’s democratically most advanced member states, Indonesia and the Philippines, are more ambiguous.

The empirical track record of such groups, however, is mixed. Drawing from theories of interest representation and social movement research, I present a novel approach to studying the effect of observer groups. Conceptualizing monitors as agenda-builders, I contend that their potential impacts rely on two factors neglected by previous studies: access to the public’s agenda, and access to policymakers. I test the impact of election monitoring on electoral integrity using cross-national time-series data of all democratic backsliding and revival episodes in Asia from 1950 to 2018. I find that domestic monitors do have more than a placebo effect, but that their capacities to immunize against democratic regression are modest at best. When neither access to the public’s agenda nor access to policymakers are present, monitors are unlikely to halt backsliding. However, public attention becomes an effective resource where groups have policy access.

However, the prevailing political realities in many African countries, including the (re-)introduction of anti-democratic policies and dubious constitutional manoeuvres by incumbent governments, as well as recent events associated with the so-called ‘Arab Spring’ have highlighted the limitations of the African Union’s existing strategy both in theory and practice. Based on a critical analysis of the African Union’s regime on unconstitutional changes of government, its normative design and practical application, this article argues that—and explains why—the organisation has so far generally overpromised, but under-delivered, on the stated goal of collectively safeguarding constitutional democracy in its member states. While recognising its achievements in the progressive development and consolidation of a regional norm outlawing unconstitutional changes of government, the analysis identifies a host of conceptual and practical problems that have hampered the capacity of the African Union to effectively deal with diverse forms of illegitimate disruptions of democratic processes in several African countries. Apart from cases involving popular uprisings, in respect of which the organisation is still in search for a coherent policy framework, there is also a lack of conceptual clarity as to which cases of democratic backsliding can be brought under the rubric of unconstitutional changes of government, as well as a general reluctance on the part of the African Union to apply its policy against incumbent governments entangled in unconstitutional preservations of power.

They contend that the old logic of Left and Right that framed political competition in the twentieth century is still there but that it has been diminished and overlaid by new lines of conflict (p. 37). Where the old logic of competition engaged in a conflict of broad goals, policies, and values, the new logic gives rise to competition without opposition. Candidates and parties in Western European democracies are less likely to stand for one part—this region, religion, or class—against others, and instead, every side claims to represent the whole. And each insists that it offers an escape from corrupt rule by elites. All promise integrity and technocratic competence. Bickerton and Invernizzi Accetti call this combination “technopopulism” and see it as the new development that accompanies what is often described in purely destructive terms as “democratic erosion” or “democratic backsliding.” Among the book’s distinctive strengths is its blend of conceptual innovation with detailed empirical case studies. The book aims to contribute to “interpretive political science,” which, as the authors explain, focuses on efficient causes by developing concepts that are necessary to identify and diagnose political change (and which complements the familiar explanatory political science centered on causal relationships). The concept at the core of the book is, of course, “technopopulism” itself, which the authors discuss with precision in the first chapter. A closely allied concept is “political logic,” which refers to the fundamental questions that “set the terms of electoral competition” (p. 23). The question that technopopulism highlights is who can most successfully combine “populist claims to represent the people as a whole with the technocratic competence to design and implement effective policy” (p. 36). On the authors’ account, the logic of technopopulism has displaced the older logic of political competition that dominated European democracies from 1890 to 1965, according to which politics expressed background economic, religious, and regional cleavages. Social cleavages gave rise to an ideological politics in which each side was compelled to recognize the partial legitimacy of its opponents, if only because social cleavages were so visible that no side could delude itself that it represented the whole. However, as social cleavages fragmented, the ideological logic of politics receded, and the connection between traditional parties and social groups was attenuated. The linkage between society and politics that parties ordinarily sustained was relaxed, and partisans themselves came to be seen by ordinary citizens as disconnected elites. This was the context for the rise of what Bickerton and Invernizzi Accetti describe in chapter 2 as “pure cases” of technopopulism: New Labor in the United Kingdom, the Five Star Movement in Italy, and Macron’s La République En March! in France. In contrast, Spain’s Podemos party and Salvini’s Lega party in Italy represent “hybrid cases,” where the old ideological logic of competition continues alongside the newer technocratic populism. Bickerton and Invernizzi Accetti chart the rise of party democracy and the familiar left-right terms of competition from 1890 through 1965 and its gradual decay from 1965 through 1990. The historical story is masterfully rendered in these pages. A core contribution of the historical narrative lies in the last episode, from 1990 to the present, where the authors show how technocratic populism captures a variety of phenomena across Western Europe since 1990. The discussion of technopopulism’s historical origins leads to consideration of its consequences: intensifying political conflict ironically combined with a draining of substantive content from politics. The electorate is disaffected while governments pursue more authoritarian and penal strategies to surveil and pacify the public (pp. 154–166). Technopopulism is not simply the erosion of familiar democratic institutions. It is, as the title of the book announces, a “new logic of democratic politics.” But it is also a logic that eats at the foundations of representative democracy. Its toxicity arises from its basis in populism’s defining quality: the claim to represent the true people exclusively, and with that, a refusal to see other participants to the political contest as legitimate. Bickerton and Invernizzi Accetti’s case studies—themselves a riveting primer in contemporary Western European politics—make a convincing argument for the rise of technopopulism. Yet, they point to questions about the capacity of technopopulism to offer a stable political logic for political competition. Technocracy might equip populist leaders to deliver the goods and therefore stabilize a form of nonpartisan (populist) majoritarian democracy— if populist technocracy worked. But as the horrific spread of COVID-19 infections that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi unleashed at his own rallies in India testify, populists often cannot abide the restraints that technocracy imposes even when they want the results that technocratic expertise promises. Technocracy’s problem, from a democratic perspective, is also its problem for populists: it empowers elites such as economists, lawyers, and scientists. Yet, the authority of the technocrat, grounded in expertise, limits the power of the populist leader, grounded in attunement with the public. This limitation stands as a potential offense that the populist leader, as the true", :year 2021, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "Perspectives on Politics", :pages "1296 - 1297", :volume "19"}, :authors []} {:paperId "98d50bd7ebb869466f55ce5bf5c83ba43b4b755c", :title "THE EU’S EASTERN PARTNERSHIP – MORE FOR MORE, OR MORE OF THE SAME?", :abstract "The Eastern Partnership (EaP) is a relatively recent form of the EU’s engagement with its Eastern neighbours, although it is firmly placed in the existing frameworks of cooperation.

Left-wing authoritarianism was linked to high levels of social cynicism, and fate control, but inversely related to the other three axioms.

First, while policy styles are commonly viewed in literature as determined by administrative traditions, political institutions and policy paradigms, Turkey’s policy style has been more responsive to electoral politics, and, until recently, problem situation, in particular crises. Second, policy style is both a cause and a consequence of regime change. Turkey’s policy style has displayed both continuities as well as differences as it descended into authoritarianism. The characteristics of the policy style gradually undermine institutions of democracy.

Estonia and Latvia provide illustrations of two stable democracies, which nevertheless have consolidated tendencies for an elite-driven and ethnic-majority-driven democratic process hollowed out of its democratic contestation. This is what I call “technocratic” and “ethnic” hollowness. This double hollowness consolidated during EU accession, which created a favourable context for well-positioned ethnic majority elites to push forward ethnocentric and neoliberal agendas while restricting the space for debating them. However, far from a symptom of backsliding in the sense of a regression into authoritarianism, double hollowness is in fact central to these democracies’ stability.

Yet it is clear that many of today’s developing-world and postcommunist democracies—including those in such countries as Bolivia, Georgia, Venezuela, and Russia—are backsliding and at risk of reversal, if this has not already occurred. New data have the potential to shed more light on the causes of democratic collapse.2 To date, experts have tended to focus on economic performance as the key to whether young democracies live or die.3 But is this obviously the case? During the early 1990s, the postcommunist democracies of Central and Eastern Europe experienced economic distress comparable to the Great Depression but did not backslide from democracy. Conversely, years of robust growth in Thailand did not prevent a military coup there in 2006. What if institutions—and in particular, political institutions—play the crucial role in democratic consolidation? The data suggest that this is so, and further point to institutions that place effective constraints on executive power as being of special importance.4 When a leader, whether a president or a prime minister, faces only weak constraints, the temptation grows to gather economic and political power into executive hands.

I find that substantial numbers of Republicans endorse statements contemplating violations of key democratic norms, including respect for the law and for the outcomes of elections and eschewing the use of force in pursuit of political ends. The strongest predictor by far of these antidemocratic attitudes is ethnic antagonism—especially concerns about the political power and claims on government resources of immigrants, African-Americans, and Latinos. The strong tendency of ethnocentric Republicans to countenance violence and lawlessness, even prospectively and hypothetically, underlines the significance of ethnic conflict in contemporary US politics. Most Republicans in a January 2020 survey agreed that “the traditional American way of life is disappearing so fast that we may have to use force to save it.” More than 40% agreed that “a time will come when patriotic Americans have to take the law into their own hands.” (In both cases, most of the rest said they were unsure; only one in four or five disagreed.)

The collapse of the Weimar Republic has led scholars of comparative politics to conclude that constitutional forms and institutions can do little to resist the breakdown of democracy and the rise of autocracy. This paper offers a constitutionalist response. The outlines of that answer can be found in decades-old policy documents produced by a set of German émigré scholars during and in the immediate aftermath of the Second World War: Franz Neumann, Herbert Marcuse, and Otto Kirchheimer. The secret reports root constitutional stability in the creation of a framework for bounded partisan pluralist contestation among political parties that track the principal social and economic cleavages, and that is rooted within, and does not seek to overthrow, the underlying political economy. Second, the secret reports highlight the importance of constitutional design in creating a constitutional infrastructure for bounded pluralistic political contestation, especially with respect to the role of political parties.

This article distinguishes right-from left-wing populism, and limited government from non-arbitrary rule, as constitutional ideals. Legal consti-tutionalism typically embraces the first ideal. However, that can be a driver of both right-and left-wing pop-ulism, and allow types of arbitrary rule that democratic backsliding and illiberal regimes can (and do) exploit. By contrast, political constitutionalism involves the second ideal and is antithetical to right-wing populism while potentially friendly to the legitimate demands of left-wing populism.

Yet others are more optimistic and have argued that democracy is in fact resilient, or that we are observing coinciding trends of democratic decline but also expansion. This forum highlights key issues in the debate on democracy's decline, which center on conceptual and measurement issues, agreement on the phenomenon but not its nature or severity, the importance of international factors, the emphasis we should put on political elites versus citizens, and the consequences of backsliding for global politics. Staffan I.

Susan D.

To address these concerns, we provide original data from surveys of political science experts and the public measuring the perceived importance and performance of U.S. democracy on a number of dimensions during the first year and a half of the Trump presidency. We draw on a theory of how politicians may transgress limits on their authority and the conditions under which constraints are self-enforcing. We connect this theory to our survey data in an effort to identify potential areas of agreement – bright lines – among experts and the public about the most important democratic principles and whether they have been violated.

But some countries have recently seen a weakening of this democracy defence potential embedded in civil society. Using Indonesia – the world's third largest democracy – as a case study, this article shows how escalating polarization can split civil society along primordial and ideological lines, eroding its ability to offer a united pro-democracy front. In the Indonesian case, the executive also used this polarization to justify increasingly illiberal measures.

In this article, I argue that democratic backsliding undermines the reporting of sexual violence even further. The author’s team conducted in-depth interviews (n = 15) with representatives of civil society organizations, victims’ services, clinical practitioners, and child and family welfare in Hungary in 2017 and 2018, in search of organizational and structural causes to why sexual violence remains vastly underreported in the country with the least reported case numbers in Europe. The small but diverse sample helped identify associations between the reporting of sexual violence and repressive, gender-related political decisions such as threatening the existence of civil organizations undertaking victim support roles and providing victim services, a family-centered political narrative, and confining women’s roles solely for reproductive purposes. It is not possible to maintain causation since there are other factors interfering the association. Thus, instead of discussing it as a single cause of underreporting sexual violence, I present the Hungarian case to illustrate the consequences of illiberal politics on reporting. Furthermore, utilizing Slovič’s risk-benefit model, I argue that recent products of illiberal politics such as politicizing “gender” undermine trust, a precondition of asking for help and providing support for victims of sexual violence.", :year 2022, :openAccessPdf {:url "https://www.cogitatiopress.com/politicsandgovernance/article/download/5519/5519", :status "GOLD"}, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "Politics and Governance"}, :authors [{:authorId "1742502087", :name "Katalin Parti"}]} {:paperId "9fcaad8bf3d1a1bd223feb31196d20a92f869878", :title "Putinism Under Siege", :abstract "he potential backsliding of the postcommunist states of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) was a major concern of scholars and the interna-tional community in the 1990s.

We understand that the present case shows interest since it allows to clearly visualize the main theoretical-methodological dimensions considered central to recognize if a democratic regime of a certain country is “in retreat”. The structure that we will adopt for our analysis will consist of two parts. The first of the axes will be devoted to discussing the main theoretical-methodological characteristics worked by the “democratic backsliding” perspective that will be considered in our analysis. Regarding the second axis, a brief historical development of the case will be carried out and the characteristics of the case will be systematized, based on the main theoretical-methodological dimensions that the selected perspective takes into consideration when characterizing how much democratic and how much authoritarian has a certain regime. In summary, our analysis will allow us to sustain that Venezuela is going through a period of “democratic backsliding”, implying the latter a progressive step from a democratic regime to one of authoritarian character.

Among others, the surging influence of populist movements in Europe in the aftermath of the 2015 migration crisis has drawn considerable attention from both scholarly and practical perspectives. The looming decay of Europe’s democratic order is considered particularly worrisome, given that European postwar democracy has long been considered to be firmly consolidated. Numerous studies of comparative politics have also shown that well-off advanced democracies are rarely vulnerable to authoritarian backsliding thanks to several self-reinforcing mechanisms associated with the democratic rules of political competition and the growth of democratic political culture and involving economic development. Against this backdrop of strong belief in the resilience of advanced liberal democracy, the recent phenomenon of the rise of far-right political parties – on a global level in general and across Europe in particular – raises the fundamental question of whether today’s liberal democracy is in serious crisis. By engaging with one of the leading political theorists Jan-Werner Müller’s recent studies on the intellectual (and political) history of democracy and populism, this essay will first discuss why it is important to revisit the contested history of twentieth-century European democracy as a way to improve our understanding of populism’s contemporary rise and then discuss how Müller’s perspective can help us develop a new vision of liberal democracy in response to the challenges from right-wing populism. Jan-Werner Müller’s latest book, What is Populism? (2016), draws huge attention in tandem with the rise of populism in Europe and the United States. Since its publication, the book has been translated into more than 24 languages, including Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, and it has become one of the core references in the study of populism. Compared to his previous book Contesting Democracy (2011), What is Populism is much thinner and easier to read, as it is written for a wider audience.

The lacking effectiveness of EU democracy policy towards member states", :abstract "In a European Union beset by multiple crises, the quality of democracy in member states, and more generally the domestic political preconditions of European policy, is particularly relevant for European integration. Without stable and functioning democracies in member states, the EU would certainly have to redefine its self-image of being a community of values, of which democracy and rule of law are key principles. In a time of rising doubts about the shape and the direction of integration, a Union of varying democratic standards could easily turn into an ever looser association of national states bound together mainly by economic interests and some foreign policy objectives rather than by shared norms. That is why developments in some member states, whether justified or not, have sparked a debate about ‘democratic backsliding’ or the advance of ‘illiberal’ tendencies in the EU. This debate involves questions concerning the response to such tendencies: When and how should the EU become active? Does it dispose of appropriate instruments? What are criteria for triggering possible reactions on the EU level? How can democratic deviance be sanctioned? Opposing this normatively inspired thrust of discussion is an orientation which argues that the EU has to respect the core of member states national competencies, especially their ‘constitutional identity’. Indeed, according to EU primary law, modifications of the political system are the exclusive domain of the national states so long as no grave non-observance of basic democratic standards is committed.

As they slipped down the international democracy rankings, the European Union initiated its procedures under Article 7 to investigate possible breaches of its fundamental laws and values. However, the two governments sought to distinguish between their conflict with the European Commission over the rule of law on one hand and their commitment to collective security on the other. The central question in this article is whether they managed to do this, and to what extent democratic backsliding poses security challenges for the EU by weakening its actorness in the field of security, defence and foreign policy. A comparative assessment of Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic suggests that democratic backsliding does indeed have security implications for the EU, but that this is only one of several factors driving differentiated integration in the Visegrád Four in this field. Developments in the region are part of a wider EU trend of re-nationalization of security policy. Indeed, in the security field, vertical differentiated integration (in the sense of different mixes of supranational and intergovernmental regimes) is a key factor in mitigating the consequences of horizontal differentiation (different Member State policies).(This article is an output of the EUFLEX project, which has been funded by the Research Council of Norway (project number 287131)).\nEU defence policy, Visegrad 4, differentiated integration, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Czech Republic, democratic backsliding, geopolitics", :year 2021, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "European Foreign Affairs Review"}, :authors [{:authorId "119510180", :name "N.

As it turns out, democracy has been proceeding and continues to differentiate the world’s nations in a strongly culture-bound manner: high levels of democracy remain a distinctive feature of nations in which emancipative values have grown strong over the generations. By the same token, backsliding and autocratization are limited to cultures with under-developed emancipative values. In line with this finding, public support for democracy neither favours democratization, nor does it prevent autocratization in disjunction from emancipative values. On the contrary, public support for democracy shows such pro-democratic effects if – and only if – it co-exists in close association with emancipative values. The reason is that – in disconnect from emancipative values – support for democracy frequently reverts its meaning, indicating the exact opposite of what intuition suggests: namely, support for autocracy.

There has been a world-wide turn to constitutionalism as a form of politics and a rapid emergence of an aggressive constitutional judiciary in many new democracies emerging from \"regimes of horror.\" I argue in this paper that the aggressiveness of constitutional courts in new democracies stems from the ability of these courts to participate in shaping the collective memory about the previous regimes of horror. Courts can then position themselves as the border guard of the boundary between past and future. Constitutions can serve as the focal point for the creation of collective memory for three reasons. First, most of the new constitutions in post-horror regimes are long ones. Long constitutions, coupled with judicial review, simply give courts more leverage for getting involved in political matters. Long constitutions also represent more pre-commitment on the part of the political powers involved in setting up the new regime about what that regime will look like and how it will be different from the previous one, pre-commitment that gives constitutional court decisions a certain amount of legitimacy. Second, a new high court with the power of judicial review in a post-horror regime can be seen as preventing the current government from turning into the previous one. The new regime is then defined constitutionally in large part by being \"not that\" past one. The constitutional politics of \"not that\" give courts quite a lot of room for maneuver, especially where there is agreement over both what the specific wrongs of the previous regime were and how these wrongs should be righted now. Where there is perceived to be a particular danger of backsliding into the regime of horror again, constitutional courts are given particularly broad powers to act. Finally, activist courts ought to be considered in a broader historical and comparative perspective. The very acceptance and success of strong constitutional review in some countries (particularly in the post-horror regimes that quickly followed WWII) have provided a reason to adopt strong constitutional review in others. While judicial review may have been a daring experiment 200 years ago, it is by now an ordinary feature of modern democratic polities around the world. Constitutional drafters insert powerful forms of judicial review as a matter of course into most, if not all, new constitutions. There is, in other words, a sort of legitimacy in numbers, where the success of aggressive judicial review in one country makes its absence in another a sign of democratic weakness.

Characteristics of a country’s civil service system determine what administrative career patterns typically look like. In the literature, two ideal-types of civil service systems are distinguished: the career-based system and the position-based system. In countries with a position-based civil service system, administrative careers usually are more diverse than in countries with a career-based civil service system. In most countries, however, intersectoral career mobility of civil servants is rather low. In democratic systems, recruitment and promotion in the civil service is formally based on merit and (with decreasing significance) seniority, while in practice political criteria and representativeness can be important selection criteria, especially for promotion to senior-level positions. As a consequence of their influential role in policy-making in many countries, research on careers in public administrations is mainly focusing on top-level positions: by analyzing the career background of top officials, public administration scholarship aims to understand the determinants of career success in public administrations as well as processes of administrative elite (re-)production and politicization. Findings from empirical studies suggest that political criteria do not crowd out meritocratic criteria in recruitment in most established democracies but that politicization can have severe negative impacts on administrative outcomes in young democracies and developing countries. Comparative empirical studies on administrative careers based on common datasets are largely lacking so far. More systematic comparative studies (across countries and over time) on administrative careers would not only make it possible to understand how larger systemic developments (e.g., administrative reform movements, democratic backsliding) affect mechanisms of recruitment and promotion in the civil service, but also help to better understand the inner mechanisms in bureaucratic organizations (e.g., by identifying organizational patterns of inequality).", :year 2020, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "", :volume ""}, :authors [{:authorId "72614472", :name "Sylvia Veit"}]} {:paperId "a3292e69cba4eba9a17190c60ec700dc4de353ea", :title "Backsliding and Reversal: The J Curve Revisited", :abstract "ABSTRACT In this article we argue that democratic transitions can reverse, oscillate, or simply stall.

This last point can lead to better compliance as it encourages individuals to identify their own errors without fear of retaliation. Of course, ex post investigations are themselves influenced by a number of cognitive biases, including outcome bias, as Tomer Broude and Inbar Levy demonstrate.

Such provisions however, were always predicated strictly within the collectivist ideological boundaries of Marxism–Leninism (pp. 115–16). The third and fourth chapters deal with fascism: Chapter 3 mostly focuses on Benito Mussolini’s original Italian iteration while Chapter 4 emphasises the key differences of its German Nazi derivative. Within both ideological strands, the notion of ‘freedom’ meant the freedom of the state to which the populace were subservient. The key difference was Nazism’s emphasis on race as the ultimate mark of national destiny (pp. 221–25), in contrast to Mussolini’s fixation on historical continuity with the Roman Empire (p. 153). By contrast, Spain’s anarchists mostly emerged as vigorous champions of democratic and social equality yet elevated them as freedoms of the collective rather than the individual (pp. 324–25). However, considering its fragmented nature, and failure to seize full control of the state, this fourth example feels miscellaneous when compared to the other three. The second section consists of a lengthy epilogue assessing democratic ‘backsliding’ in Victor Orbán’s Hungary and Poland under the Law and Justice party (pp. 354–75). This is accompanied by a more detailed analysis of processes leading up to the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States which, Ramet warns, is indicative of a similar trend, characterised by nationalist politics and ‘sado-populism’, an erosion of civil liberties, and a retreat from government accountability (pp. 412–13). Orbán’s recent passing of an emergency law—granting him the power to rule by decree—adds an additional sense of urgency to this warning. Her observations are accompanied by an overview of what she deems as liberal democracy’s inherent strengths in allowing societies to culturally and socially evolve by permitting individual freedoms. These are caveated however, by its vulnerabilities: public disengagement from the political process, the ease with which hate speech and divisive rhetoric can now be spread via the internet, and greater openness to corruption through media and business monopolies (pp. 345–54). As with many of her previous contributions, Alternatives to Democracy follows Ramet’s quintessential style in terms of both its scope and ambition. Unfortunately, this also includes a propensity to shift from copiously detailed to frustratingly vague as well as her rather dogmatic, and somewhat overly theorised, methods of framing. In particular, while economic inequality and the threat of plutocracy are discussed, they are never fully explored as a contextual impediment to liberal democracy’s stability; neither the Great Depression nor the 2008 Global Financial Crisis are even mentioned despite both arguably coming to define the past and present crises under discussion.

To address the Copenhagen Dilemma, this paper will examine the effectiveness of one central mechanism that they EU (specifically, the European Commission) may use to enforce democratic principles: infringement procedures. First, a conceptual analysis of the Copenhagen Dilemma, which serves a a framework for the subsequent study of infringement procedures, is conducted. Subsequently, five cases in which the Commission has launched infringement procedures against Hungary, Romania or Bulgaria to redress instances of democratic backsliding are examined. Each case study ultimately aims to determine what (if any) level of compliance the Commission achieved, and whether or not it is possible to establish a causal relationship between the infringement procedure and that achievement. The results are cautiously optimistic, as several case studies demonstrate both compliance and causality.

These cases are rightly perceived as component parts of an accountability process in which the Court's tactical (rather than principled) use of structural constitutional ideas played a key role.", :year 2019, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "", :volume ""}, :authors [{:authorId "115254703", :name "Aziz Z Huq"}]} {:paperId "a598e93ac8bcc1aa5df0274091993aa2d89e6425", :title "Towards a Conceptual Framework for Struggles over Democracy in Backsliding States: Gender Equality Policy in Central Eastern Europe", :abstract "Trends of de-democratization across Europe and the Americas are emerging, along with opposition to gender equality and threats to previous gender equality policy gains.

Backsliding in gender policies, and new forms of feminist engagement with hostile states and publics, also raise new challenges to the literature on gender and politics. In this article we explore gender equality policy backsliding in fragile democracies. Backsliding and de-democratization processes in these contexts pose a series of important challenges to how we have thought about gender policy change in progressive, mainly Western democratic contexts until now. We propose a conceptual framework discussing these two conceptually interesting realms: backsliding in gender equality policies, and feminist responses to backsliding. We illustrate our framework with empirical observations from four backsliding or temporarily backsliding Central and Eastern European countries: Croatia, Hungary, Poland and Romania.

This makes Robert Wuthnow latest book, Why Religion Is Good for American Democracy, a welcome contribution. With multiple nations experiencing democratic backsliding and an abrupt awareness among US scholars that the United States is not immune to this, Wuthnow offers compelling arguments, bridging interdisciplinary literatures, on how religion helps US democracy thrive. Wuthnow integrates an impressive array of findings from history, political science, sociology, and theology and integrates them into a coherent sociological narrative. In Chapter 1, Wuthnow introduces his argument acknowledging that democracies are threatened by tyranny from within. Providing a helpful point of reference for subsequent examples, Wuthnow details religious individuals’ and organizations’ warranted concern over federal overreach throughout US history. He begins with Roosevelt administration. Critics, religious and otherwise, were concerned that the centralization of powers supporting economic reform would give the government excuses to intrude upon civil liberties. With fascism rising in Europe, critics were increasingly concerned that the United States was next. However, not all were opposed to Roosevelt’s New Deal policies. In fact, many turned to theological concerns for the poor as a means of promoting Roosevelt’s reforms. And this state of disagreement safeguarded US democracy at least as much as anti-authoritarian movements themselves. Not only were potentially authoritarian impulses public warned against, and a strong administration had its policy moves scrutinized, but a diversity of views on the New Deal among US religious groups led to a robust public sphere, built on civic engagement and healthy debate. This itself provides healthy grounds for democratic consolidation in multiple theoretical traditions. 1102497 ISS0010.1177/02685809221102497International SociologyReviews: Political Sociology book-review2022", :year 2022, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes ["Review"], :journal {:name "International Sociology", :pages "214 - 217", :volume "37"}, :authors [{:authorId "50730649", :name "Kenneth R Vaughan"}]} {:paperId "a5dfd01130d06a6df7d0504cf592e937fb109461", :title "How Voters Respond to Presidential Assaults on Checks and Balances: Evidence from a Survey Experiment in Turkey", :abstract "Why do voters support executive aggrandizement? One possible answer is that they do so because they think this will ease their preferred leader’s hand in putting their partisan vision into action, provided that the leader will continue winning elections. We study this phenomenon through a survey experiment in Turkey, by manipulating voters’ perceptions about the potential results of the first presidential election after a constitutional referendum of executive aggrandizement. We find that voters from both sides display what we call “elastic support” for executive aggrandizement; that is, they change previously revealed constitutional preferences in response to varying winning chances. This elasticity increases not only when citizens feel greater social distance to perceived political “others” (i.e., affective polarization) but also when voters are concerned about economic management in a potential post-incumbent era. Our findings contribute to the literature on how polarization and economic anxiety contribute to executive aggrandizement and democratic backsliding. 1", :year 2022, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes ["JournalArticle" "Review"], :journal {:name "Comparative Political Studies", :pages "1947 - 1980", :volume "55"}, :authors [{:authorId "123317062", :name "Aytuğ Şaşmaz"} {:authorId "145460936", :name "Alper H.

However, subnational politics is an important, under-studied, component of regime consolidation. This study uses mayoral races in Hungary and Poland from 2006 to 2018 to examine two factors that may inhibit dominant-party regime consolidation in local politics: the use of two-round, i.e. runoff, electoral systems and strategic coordination among opposition parties. While we find little evidence that strategic coordination can lead to widespread opposition success in single-round systems, we do find that increasing the number of candidates decreases the likelihood of the nationally dominant party winning in the first round while not affecting the second round. As such, two-round mayoral elections may be an important buffer to dominant-party regime consolidation and may provide a training ground for the future opposition.", :year 2021, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "Government and Opposition", :pages "508 - 531", :volume "57"}, :authors [{:authorId "1401213967", :name "Conor O’Dwyer"} {:authorId "144128078", :name "M.

While much has been written on intra-EU controversies, less is known about the structure and evolution of Turkish parliamentary discourse on EU membership. This paper presents a first comprehensive analysis of an original dataset on Turkish parliamentary debates between 2004 and 2017 using descriptive tools and discourse network analysis (DNA). We identify three discursive phases in contemporary EU-Turkey relations: bumpy start (2004-2005), enthusiasm (2006-2012), accession fatigue and backlash (2013-2017). While the incumbent party in Turkish politics, the AKP, has been championing EU membership for larger parts of its tenure in office, beginning in 2013, we observe a shift in Turkish political discourse. Ever since the AKP has becoming increasingly lukewarm to EU membership, joining the MHP in the camp of opponents. A new discourse coalition of “strange bedfellows” has emerged subsequently: the main opposition party, CHP, and the HDP, now represent the main proponents of EU membership. Specifically, we put forward that the shift in discourse post-2012 coincides with the incumbent party’s authoritarization tendencies. While the AKP has initially instrumentalized the EU to bolster its power, the goal of EU membership has recently, and discursively speaking, more closely aligned the CHP and HDP as a means to counteract democratic backsliding. Given its societal implications, we suggest future research – especially on candidate countries – to systematically scrutinize links between discourse, compliance with EU law as well as democratic backsliding towards understanding the repercussions of changing discursive patterns. ∗PhD candidate at Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich, European Politics Research Group, alper.baysan@eup.gess.ethz.ch †PhD candidate at Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Department of Historical Studies, sina.ozdemir@ntnu.no", :year 2019, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal nil, :authors [{:authorId "119229008", :name "A.

The main argument of the Article is that paradoxically the non-legitimate 1989 constitution provided full-fledged protection of fundamental rights, while the procedurally legitimate 2011 constitution-making resulted in curtailment of rights and their constitutional guarantees. The Article first describes the democratic transition that occurred in 1989–1990 as a rights revolution and the results of the 2011 “illiberal” constitution, called Fundamental Law, as counter-revolution. The second part of the Article illustrates the constitutional and statutory regulation of human rights protection after this “rule of law revolution,” and the activist jurisprudence of the first Constitutional Court using the concept of an “invisible constitution” to protect human rights. The third part discusses the rights provisions of the new Fundamental Law and several statutes dismantling the guarantees of human rights, with special attention to the decreased possibilities of state institutions, such as the Constitutional Court, the ordinary judiciary and ombudsmen, as well as civil society organizations to effectively protect fundamental rights. The fourth part assesses the efforts of European institutions to force the Hungarian government to comply with the human rights standards laid down in the European Convention of Human Rights and in the Treaty of the European Union.

Through our three-legged framework, we examine how these religious populists behave in power and how strategic necessities, the realities of governing, and structural constraints shape their policies. Similar to the other populists in other parts of the world, before coming to power, Islamist populists make sweeping promises to the people and quick fixes to major problems of the country—most famously, quick and substantial economic development. While they may want to retain their uncompromising style and lofty goals, the realities of governing force populists to make serious compromises to their designated ‘enemies’ and on their values once they are in power. Finally, like other authoritarian politicians, Islamist populists attack formal institutions of democracy such as the judiciary, the media, and civil society; they politicize them, evacuate them, and eventually capture them from within.

Second, I examine deeper challenges to democracy that have received marginal attention in democratization studies. I argue that (i) an effective state able to claim a monopoly on legitimate violence, secure the rule of law, and provide basic public services as well as (ii) a “good” government relatively clean from widespread corruption, accountable to the public, and promote economic growth and social welfare are critical to the deepening of democracy over the long-run. I draw data from Freedom House, the Mo Ibrahim Index on Governance in Africa, and the Afrobarometer to measure several of these indicators across countries.

In it, Feith asked the question “why has parliamentary democracy failed in Indonesia?”. His fellow Indonesianist, Harry Benda, however, criticized Feith for asking the “wrong” question, as he felt a more appropriate question was “why should democracy have survived?” in Indonesia. In a 1964 review of Feith’s book, Benda argued that democracy would never survive in Indonesia because Javanese feudalistic culture was still very much alive. Ken Setiawan and Dirk Tomsa’s book, Politics in Contemporary Indonesia: Institutional Change, Policy Challenges and Democratic Decline, addresses the perennial question about the fate and future of Indonesian democracy, particularly after Reformasi in 1998. In thirteen chapters, the authors provide readers with an encyclopedic overview of the many facets of contemporary Indonesian politics and society, including the electoral system, local government, the role of Islam, civil society and the media, public health, gender inequality, human rights, environmental politics and foreign policy. The book echoes a worrying opinion common among many Indonesianists, that the country is experiencing a democratic regression characterized by increasingly “illiberal” trends. To support this observation, some scholars have cited the rise of conservative Islamic politics, the restrictions imposed on opposition groups and the reduced protections for minority groups. What Setiawan and Tomsa have done differently in their book is to examine Indonesia’s democratic backsliding over a range of issues. The authors do so while standing firmly on their institutionalist perspective. Throughout the book, they illustrate how the institutional framework and design of Indonesia’s electoral and governance systems have contributed to the decline of democratic values and practices.

During the 2019 Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement in Hong Kong, pro-democracy protesters formed the “Yellow Economic Circle” to diversify their protest strategies. They advocated dining at like-minded “Yellow” restaurants while boycotting “Blue” restaurants operated by pro-Beijing owners and corporations. The subsequent District Council Election in November recorded the highest turnout in Hong Kong’s electoral history and a remarkable victory for pro-democracy candidates. It is possible that political consumerism increases turnouts and vote shares for candidates whose political ideologies are in alignment with causes politically aware consumers embrace. These campaigns may serve as instruments for pro-democracy citizens to resist democratic erosion by galvanizing support for pro-democracy candidates through persuasion and mobilization. Using data from a popular local food service review platform, I implement a difference-in-differences model to test whether the concentration of pro-democracy restaurants in a constituency district affects voter turnouts and vote shares for prodemocracy candidates. I find no statistically significant evidence of such effects. The Yellow Economic Circle might not generate a far-reaching electoral impact given the prevalence of community-based businesses in Hong Kong, which enables neighbors to have prior knowledge of each other’s political preferences, making it challenging to sway voters. This thesis aims to bring the existing literature on political consumerism and democratic backsliding into conversation with one another. Whereas prior research largely focuses on established democracies, investigating the case of Hong Kong—a hybrid regime—adds nuances to our understanding of the social effects of political consumerism. Furthermore, this thesis attempts to answer a newly emerging research question in democratic backsliding: whether social movements led mostly by private businesses and citizens can provide effective resistance to elite-led democratic erosion.

In this Essay, I dispute that contention. An examination of both federal theory on one hand and the behavior and tactics of central control employed by ancient and early modern empires on the other leads to the conclusion that the protective value of federalism against the effects of national authoritarianism is indeterminate and depends upon a host of contingencies. These include the particular structure of the federal state in question; the specific pathways of influence available to subnational units to protect their autonomy in any given federal structure; and the goals, motivations, and determination of governments and populations at both levels. However, a few suggest the outcome in any particular case, though contingent on many details, might nonetheless be subject to certain general tendencies, and these tendencies by and large favor an eventual strangling of subnational liberal democracy. First, autocratic the exercise to matters of indifference to the state, and in today’s world there may well be few matters as to which authoritarian government is truly the tendency in all autocracies, as they become better established, has been continually to tighten social and political controls, making successful opposition to the regime increasingly as time passes. the tactics of subnational and self-defense that are most likely to be successful in a centrally authoritarian federation tend to be self-defeating because they require behavior that is largely incompatible with the very liberal democracy it would aim to Thus, the survival of subnational liberal democracy in a centrally authoritarian federation, although not theoretically impossible, would require an extremely fortunate confluence of highly favorable and unlikely contingencies.", :year 2021, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal nil, :authors [{:authorId "97333347", :name "James A.

With the rise of China on the international stage, the spread of undemocratic norms, values and standards of behavior possibly associated with its increasing ties with many states around the world has specifically emerged as an area of concern. For Canada, a country having incorporated democracy-promotion into its foreign policy strategy, assessing the magnitude of such risk is a necessary step towards eventual policy adjustments aimed at countering autocratic influences abroad. In this article, we investigate the extent to which economic, political and security linkages with China contribute to the prevalence of media self-censorship, a behavior which has been associated with democratic backsliding in transitional regimes. We find a positive, significant and robust positive correlation between these variables. Strategic behavior by the China, actions by leaders of transitional regimes seeking to consolidate their rule, and the passive diffusion of norms, values and standards of behavior are proposed as likely mechanisms for the observed link.

To bring culture back in, I demonstrate that (1) the countries’ membership in culture zones explains some 70% of the global variation in autocracy-vs-democracy and (2) that this culture-bound variation has remained astoundingly constant over time – in spite of all the trending patterns in the global distribution of regime types over the last 120 years. Furthermore, the explanatory power of culture zones over autocracy-vs-democracy roots in the cultures’ differentiation on “authoritarian-vs-emancipative values.” Against this backdrop, lasting regime turnovers happen as a corrective response to glacially accruing regime-culture misfits – driven by generational value shifts into a pre-dominantly emancipatory direction. Consequently, the backsliding of democracies into authoritarianism is limited to societies in which emancipative values remain under-developed. Contrary to the widely cited deconsolidation-thesis, the prevalent generational profile in people’s moral orientations exhibits an almost ubiquitous ascension of emancipative values that will lend more, not less, legitimacy to democracy in the future.", :year 2021, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "Democratization", :pages "992 - 1016", :volume "28"}, :authors [{:authorId "145944167", :name "C.

This is not a simply book about elections and democracy; it is a book that confronts an old debate head-on with a new dataset. Readers expecting to learn about elections and democracy may be disappointed; but readers who understand that the subtitle refers to the long-running debate about the relative merits of consensual and majoritarian democracies are likely to find this book a welcome addition to their library. Those familiar with Arend Lijphart’s work, and who have a strong opinion about it, will find something to ponder in almost every chapter. The volume is a collection of essays about the extent to which elections produce representation and accountability in countries with the Westminster and consensual models. Given the salience of these issues, with the recent bout of hung parliaments in majoritarian systems and ‘democratic backsliding’ in several consensual democracies, this is a very timely addition to OUP’s Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES) Series. The central theme in the book is Lijphart’s ideas about consensual democracies being kinder, gentler models of democracy. Do majoritarian democracies provide better accountability? Are consensual democracies better at representing their citizens? At the end of the day, which model serves democracy best? The question many of the contributors end up answering is how much difference one can reasonably expect electoral system reform to make? As students of French and Italian politics will immediately recognise, the answers is: not very much. Or, as the editor puts it, ‘Formal political institutions are less relevant for people’s attitudes and behaviour that often presumed’ (p. 19); so the book provides ‘a lesson in modesty for institutional engineers’ (p. 19). The contribution this volume makes hinges on the use of the CSES database, which offers an up-to-date addition to Lijphart’s work and covers a wider range of countries. In addition, in contrast to Lijphart’s focus on aggregate, macro-level, data, the CSES data used in this volume also includes micro-level data on individuals’ social positions, policy preferences, perceptions about institutions and government performance as causes, and political participation, voting, party preferences, and satisfaction with how democracy and electoral systems work as effects. As is usually the case in edited volumes, some chapters offer more new and surprising findings than others. Most of the findings corroborate, support or at least do not contradict Lijphart’s work: in PR systems, voter participation and policy-voting is higher, social structures more important and overall satisfaction with democracy higher. Examples of more noteworthy findings include Bernhard Wessels and Hermann Schmitt’s conclusion that political supply (parties with clear profiles) is more important in producing clear voting and choices than intuitions; Steven Weldon and Russell Dalton’s point that although consensual systems encourage more voting, this turns out to have a clear negative effect on other forms of participation; and Sören Holmberg’s observation", :year 2016, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "West European Politics", :pages "399 - 400", :volume "39"}, :authors [{:authorId "119510180", :name "N.

However, this narrative conflicts with the situation on the ground and with expert surveys, which depict incremental, yet persistent democratic backsliding in recent years. A shift towards illiberal practices, primarily focused on the liberal part of the liberal-democratic nexus, is taking place. This research aims to explore the prevalence and causes for the re-emergence of illiberal practices in Croatia by employing an interpretive method to evidence gathered from media articles and research reports published 2013–2019. The use of illiberal policies by the governing Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) in three areas of the political system – the capture of independent agencies, control of the judiciary, and the weakening of independent media – is found to be the driver of democratic backsliding. Causes are found in structural reasons linked to the dominant party.

As I demonstrate, court ideologists of populist autocrats use Carl Schmitt’s concept of political sovereignty and collective identity of the people, or misuse Max Weber’s leader democracy or Richard Bellamy’s or others’ political constitutionalism ideas to legitimize authoritarian aims. I argue that the constitutional concept, which rejects liberalism as a constitutive precondition of democracy, cannot be in compliance with the traditional idea of liberal democratic constitutionalism. This concept has nothing to do with any majoritarian constitutional model based on the separation of power, or with political constitutionalism, or any kind of weak judicial review, and it misuses the concept of constitutional identity. \n \nOne of the reasons of the illiberal turn has been that there was a lack of consensus about liberal democratic values at the time of the transition. In the beginning of the democratic transitions in these new democracies, preference was given to general economic effectiveness over mass civic and political engagement. According to some authors, the prospects for liberal constitutional democracy in the newly independent states of Central and Eastern Europe following the 1989–90 transition were diminished by a technocratic, judicial control of politics, which blunted the development of civic constitutionalism, civil society, and participatory democratic government as necessary counterpoints to the technocratic machinery of legal constitutionalism. But, there is nothing to suggest that an earlier and more participatory constitution-making process would have prevented the populist turn. Those proponents of participatory constitutionalism do not sufficiently take into account the rise of populism and the lack of civic interest in constitutional matters, due to poor constitutional culture. The recent success of illiberalism in the region seems to indicate that the special historical circumstances require a longer period of time the build up a liberal democratic political and constitutional culture.

Some, mainly democracies like New Zealand and South Korea, took quick health measures without curbing citizen rights. Others, especially those led by populists like Bolsonaro and Erdogan, denied the seriousness of the health crisis even as they curbed political and civil rights. El Salvador is virtually unique in its COVID-19 response, combining a strong rhetorical commitment to health measures with clear efforts to undermine democratic controls and rights. President Nayib Bukele adopted an early travel ban and publicly vilified those who broke curfew by sending them and all who tested positive to quarantine centers for 30 days. He derided and defied Constitutional Chamber decisions against such practices, ordered militarized actions, and crowded gang-affiliated prisoners together in humiliating ways that risked exposure to COVID-19. We examine how Bukele’s policies conform to, and seemingly exemplify, Michel Foucault’s theoretical concepts of biopolitics and disciplinary power. However, the Salvadoran case also challenges key features of Foucault’s theory, suggesting the need to modify his Western assumptions about highly institutionalized states.

Locating the Role of Civil Society in Anti-corruption Policy Outcomes", :abstract "Quantitative, and to a much lesser degree qualitative, research is the dominant approach to corruption. However, the call to investigate the contextual dependencies of corruption is brought about by the failure of anti-corruption approaches that do not tackle other actors or institutions and issues simultaneously. One approach that can tackle the complex nature of corruption from this perspective but remains wanting in corruption research is Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA). Much more limited is the application of QCA in understanding civil society’s anti-corruption role. The supposed place of civil society in anti-corruption is even more compounded by contemporary events that directly assault their presence in countries, regardless of the type of government or economic development in place. This closing of civic space phenomenon is part of the broader democratic backsliding or autocratization that has pervaded even long standing and consolidated democracies. Locating the place of civil society given such contexts poses a daunting challenge, as one may ask: if democratic grounds are backsliding, where are anti-corruption efforts anchored on? As such, the dissertation intends to look at configurations of (democratic) political institutions that enhance or mitigate corruption while trying to locate the position occupied by civil society in this respect. Taking a cue from the civil society-corruption nexus and the broader democracy-corruption linkage scholarship, with institutionalism as an overarching theory, the dissertation hopes to contribute to the discourse via three related studies. Results • The first of these serves as a springboard for the argument that civil society cannot battle corruption all alone. While internal civil society characteristics may have a part in corruption mitigation, through a large-N quantitative analysis, the study highlights the importance of civil society environment, transparency of laws and predictability of enforcement and rigorousness and impartiality of public administration on corruption. • Noting that the formula derived from regression analyses shows the average net effects of the independent variables, the second study looks at the combinatorial effects of conditions necessary and/or sufficient for the outcome high perceived corruption to occur through fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA). o The configurational analysis of 33 episodes of contemporary autocratization from the third wave (1994- 2017) confirm the conditionality of civil society’s effects as the condition robust civil society organizations combines with the presence of extensive media freedoms and simultaneously the presence of wide and independent public deliberations to produce the outcome high perceived corruption. o The pathway to corruption in these states experiencing autocratization also includes two sufficient conditions: the presence of high political exclusion as well as the absence of sociopolitical integration. No necessary precondition was found for the outcome presence of high perceived corruption. Given the pretext of equifinality and multifinality in QCA, the third study extends the second but in the context of 30 democracies that did not experience substantial autocratization episodes in the same given period. o The results are interesting although not surprising under the theoretical underpinnings of QCA: the absence of high perceived corruption in non-autocratizing states is not brought about by robust civil society organizations (in their presence or absence; or individually or in combination with other conditions) but instead by the presence of wide and independent public deliberations combined with the absence of high political exclusion. The latter is also a necessary condition for the outcome of interest. o While the conditionality of civil society’s effect is confirmed in the second study, the third highlights the possibility of the differential impacts of civil society depending on context.

The author argues that democracy requires and presupposes fundamental rights, but that these two values do not always align, and then deals with the question of how to reconcile democracy and fundamental rights in case of conflict. The potential conflict between the two values is sometimes reflected in the relationship between Parliaments as the embodiment of democracy and the Constitutional Courts as the embodiments of fundamental rights (the so- called \"counter-majoritarian dilemma\"). However, the author rejects the recent critique by some scholars that the German Federal Constitutional Court structurally exceeds its powers vis-a-vis the German Parliament and that there is a permanent judicial overreach. On the contrary, the author argues that Constitutional Courts do not have sufficient tools to counter a democratic backsliding, i.e. the incremental erosion of democracy. Since the author considers democratic backsliding to be a greater and more acute threat to democracy than judicial overreach, he presents the view that the guarantee of the essential content of a right delineates the minimum of a fundamental right in a democratic society.

This article offers an explanation based on the feminist critique of structural and theoretical flaws within liberalism and argues that these flaws are used effectively by right-wing populism to endanger liberal democracy. Using feminist critiques of political liberalism, including critiques of the public/private and political/non-political distinctions, the article claims that the liberal choice to allow the flourishing of bigotry and intolerance in the private sphere and to require respect for equality only in the public sphere has made liberalism vulnerable to the right-wing populist attack. Political liberalism has rejected the feminist call to recognize that the personal is political and has relied on political institutions and processes as barriers against illiberalism. Liberal states applying these principles are therefore ill equipped to fight right-wing populists who rally their supporters around the promise to do away with political institutions and to let the populist leaders turn their private prejudices into public policy. The article calls for a redrawing of the lines between the political and non-political, and between the public and the private, to meet the challenge of right-wing populism.", :year 2021, :openAccessPdf {:url "https://academic.oup.com/icon/article-pdf/19/2/393/39200741/moab032.pdf", :status "BRONZE"}, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "International Journal of Constitutional Law"}, :authors [{:authorId "116744600", :name "Gila Stopler"}]} {:paperId "addd20b5a9187c8b8fdce5b4f6c6ff1893a89245", :title "Papua New Guinea: New approaches to quantifying democratic backslide", :abstract nil, :year 2015, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "", :volume ""}, :authors [{:authorId "107602696", :name "Zachary Swain Lyford"}]} {:paperId "ade6ff2c2c7f5da0ee34a1457bef55d6490614ae", :title "How to Build and Consolidate a Partly Free Pseudo Democracy by Constitutional Means in Three Steps: The ‘Hungarian Model’", :abstract "With Orban’s autocratic constitutional revolution in mind, one may distinguish between three main legal steps when it comes to establishing and consolidating a partly free, pseudo democracy in a country where a democratic regime based on the rule of law was previously said to be consolidated: (i) Rewrite the constitution to make it ‘autocracy-compatible’; (ii) Organise a legislative blitzkrieg, allegedly in the name of implementing the new constitutional order, so as to conceal a process of capture (or dismantlement) of all national checks and balances; (iii) Make a strategic use (when necessary) of the constitution and/or the (captured) constitutional court to further consolidate and/or defend the new autocratic constitutional order.

As a result, the “return of the state” as an economic actor, especially in emerging markets, has left scholars without the necessary tools to capture this trend of the “politicization of the economic.” Thus, we argue that current conceptualizations of state-dominated systems as “authoritarian capitalism” too easily lump together countries as diverse as China, Singapore, and Norway under this heading. Rather than considering any type of state intervention in the economy as authoritarian, we propose a more sophisticated conceptualization of the extension of the political into the economic, which allows us to clearly distinguish cases of “state capitalism” from “authoritarian capitalism.” We apply our framework to the case of Hungary to illustrate that a more precise definition of “authoritarian capitalism” makes it a useful tool to understand contexts beyond the Chinese case in which it first emerged. Based on interviews with business leaders in Hungary under Viktor Orban’s government, we identify the mechanisms by which an authoritarian government expands the political into the economic realm, eroding the public-private divide; moving thus from “democratic backsliding” into “economic backsliding.”", :year 2019, :openAccessPdf {:url "http://gala.gre.ac.uk/id/eprint/23646/7/23646%20SALLAI_What_Makes_Authoritarian_Capitalism_Authoritarian_2019.pdf", :status "GREEN"}, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "SSRN Electronic Journal"}, :authors [{:authorId "118786998", :name "Dorottya Sallai"} {:authorId "98293002", :name "Gerhard Schnyder"}]} {:paperId "af4616d2a1fe6c6f7870caad4a05b1efc63198c7", :title "Democracy Talks in Manila: The Role of Youth Voices in Democracy", :abstract "There are various challenges to democracy which have worsened during the Covid-19 pandemic.

But critics argue that merely being democratic in nature may not be the main reason for peace between democracies. Throughout the 21st century, we have witnessed the “War on Terrorism” after 9/11, the rise of multipolarity, several buffer zones underpinning major powers’ divisive politics and reflection of national leaders’ decisions on regional cooperatives and international institutions, etc., which have had varying effects on international politics. Therefore, this study begs a question that whether the implications of democratic peace theory are justified in the 21st century or not. Answering this question required a thorough review of the arguments put forward by democratic peace theorists and detractors. This article examines the justification of democratic peace theory by focusing on the remarkable political phenomena in the 21st century. The method of this study is based on the thematic literature review and in-depth study of the documents and summaries comprised of articles and journals. This study found that authoritarianism, democratic backsliding, the rise of populism, contentious politics, border and regional conflicts, violent annexation, etc. have become critical issues in democracies where neither the values of democracy are protected, nor the liberal ideology is followed in the state mechanisms.\nSocial Science Review, Vol. 39(1), June 2022 Page 211-229", :year 2023, :openAccessPdf {:url "https://www.banglajol.info/index.php/SSR/article/download/64921/44266", :status "HYBRID"}, :publicationTypes ["JournalArticle" "Review"], :journal {:name "Social Science Review"}, :authors [{:authorId "2214350999", :name "Sharmin Bhuiya"} {:authorId "2070077912", :name "Miskat Jahan"}]} {:paperId "afa776481d2dc19549988cde383b953580d1289e", :title "\"King Bibi\" and Israeli Illiberalism: Assessing Democratic Backsliding in Israel during the Second Netanyahu Era (2009–2021)", :abstract "Abstract:This article assesses democratic backsliding in Israel during Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's years in office from 2009 to 2021, drawing comparisons to similar developments in Hungary and Turkey.

Second, slippage between macro and micro level analysis of backsliding can make it difficult to draw solid inferences about attitudes.

It begins by noting that political instability in one country can have a negative spillover and impede the economic success of regional integration. Domestic political instability may also hinder cooperation among member states. Thus, domestic political stability is a collective good for regional integration organization (RIO) member states. Legalizing democratic conditionality helps member states to overcome collective action problems and equips RIOs with the necessary credibility, justification, and tools for intervention in member states’ domestic political affairs. In addition, RIOs deepen economic integration among member states, which in turn raises the stakes for the member states to collectively defend democratic institutions and inflates the costs of sanctions for countries under threat. We test the main arguments using data gathered for 40 RIOs in the world. The econometric analyses of RIO coup rates and democratic backsliding rates demonstrate that democracy clauses are indeed effective in preventing coups and backsliding within countries that are members of RIOs with such clauses. Moreover, an analysis of democratic gains indicates that democracy clauses are also effective in the promotion of democracy within RIO member states.", :year 2015, :openAccessPdf {:url "https://cadmus.eui.eu/bitstream/1814/36318/1/RSCAS_2015_48.pdf", :status "GREEN"}, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "ERN: Other Development Economics: Regional & Country Studies (Topic)"}, :authors [{:authorId "2639936", :name "Gaspare M.

This article shifts the focus to welfare states in countries with declining democratic institutions and rising right-wing populist rule to explore a complex relationship between (de)democratization and welfare state reforms. We conduct a comparative case study of two extreme cases of democratic decline, Turkey and Hungary. We employ a sequential mixed method approach. First, we assess welfare efforts in the two countries to understand which policy areas were prioritized and whether autocratizing governments retrenched or expanded their welfare states. In the second stage, we explore the trajectory of welfare reforms in Hungary and Turkey, focusing on three analytically distinguishable dimensions of social policy change: policy content, policy procedures (including timing, parliamentary procedures, veto players); and the discourses accompanying reforms. We find that democratic decline facilitates rapid welfare state change but it does not necessarily mean retrenchment. Instead we observe ambivalent processes of welfare state restructuring. Common themes emerging in both countries are the rise of flagship programmes that ensure electoral support, a transition towards top-down decision-making and the salient role of discourse in welfare governance. Overall, similarities are stronger in procedures and discourse than in the direction of reforms. Differences in spending levels and policy content do not suggest that the two cases constitute a coherent illiberal welfare state regime.

The EU’s self-conception of being a “rule maker” rather than a “rule taker” in international relations, however, is increasingly contested both by internal (e.g., democratic backsliding or a general tendency towards nationalist politics) as well as external challenges (e.g., the return of bilateralism or the rise of new actors). China’s Belt and Road Initiative (bri) is often understood as the most serious opposition on the external side to the EU’s model of international cooperation and global governance, in that it promotes a pragmatic instead of a norm-based approach, at least at first glance. The Chinese foreign policy model that the bri reflects, explicitly favours open membership, flexibility and economic gains over multilateral institutions and norm-based action. By drawing on original interviews and analysing central policy documents, this article shows how the juxtaposition of normativity and pragmatism has shaped the political and academic discourse on the EU’s foreign policy and idea of global governance. It argues that this duality of normativity versus pragmatism is misleading because it overlooks the fact that the EU and China both (a) constitute the framework for a certain practice and (b) are rooted in practice. Drawing on Kagan’s cultural thesis of foreign policy, it questions the real meaning of this juxtaposition and applies a practice-based reading to the EU’s and China’s modes of foreign policy making.

During this time, the European People’s Party (EPP) has been criticized for its unwillingness to vote for measures that would sanction the Hungarian Fidesz government, one of its members, in breach of key democratic principles since 2010. In this paper, we seek to understand how cohesive the EPP group has been on fundamental values-related votes, how the position of EPP MEPs on these issues has evolved over time, and what explains intra-EPP disagreement on whether to accommodate fundamental values violators within the EU. To address these questions, we analyse the votes of EPP MEPs across 24 resolutions on the protection of EU fundamental values between 2011 and 2019. Our findings reveal below-average EPP cohesion on these votes, and a sharp increase in the tendency of EPP MEPs to support these resolutions over time. A number of factors explain the disagreements we find. While the EPP’s desire to maintain Fidesz within its ranks is central, this explanation does not offer a comprehensive account of the group’s accommodative behaviour. In particular, we find that ideological factors as well as the strategic interests of national governments at the EU level are central to understanding the positions of EPP MEPs, as well as the evolution of these positions over time.

Among various labels proposed to define Turkey’s new regime type, ‘competitive authoritarianism’ (CA) has by far outdistanced its rivals. As plenty of time has passed since its coinage, it is timely to commence a scholarly discussion on the appropriateness of the term. Our analysis reveals that the CA argument comes with three major shortcomings when applied to the case of Turkey. First, although its proponents discuss the concept adequately and seem to find abundant evidence to convince most of their audience, they undertake little, if any, theoretical discussion to show why CA is more plausible than its alternatives. Second, although the party system is generally regarded as the main indicator of a certain regime type, the link between the two remains un(der)-explored. Third, the mechanism leading to the transition to CA is not fully identified. We conclude that experts have jumped on the CA bandwagon, dubbing Turkey’s authoritarian regime competitive authoritarian without sufficient conceptual sophistication; this has proved deleterious rather than beneficial to the relevant literature.", :year 2022, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "Third World Quarterly", :pages "496 - 512", :volume "44"}, :authors [{:authorId "2081584497", :name "D.

Subsidized speech can leverage the government’s voice while silencing or diminishing voices that seek to challenge the government’s message or create the background conditions for critical faculties. This leveraging, in turn, serves to entrench the power of the political majority, further insulating it from the processes of democratic change. \n \nDespite the voluminous literature on free speech, few discuss the problem of subsidized speech, even though it plays an ever-growing role in the formation of public discourse and public opinion. Accordingly, the Article makes three contributions. First, the Article examines three jurisdictions (Israel, Hungary, and Poland), arguing that the strategic use of subsidized speech is particularly prevalent in countries that are experiencing some version of “democratic backsliding.” The commonalities between these countries are no accident, for the motivation is the same: increasing governmental domination of civil society. \n \nSecond, the Article departs from the extant approaches that identify subsidized speech as a problem for free speech or equality, by situating subsidized speech as a structural problem for democracy: majoritarian entrenchment. Although democracies have mechanisms to prevent entrenchment of the current political majority, those focus on elections and related aspects. Entrenchment, however, is not confined to these contexts. The Article thus extends the problem of entrenchment to the speech context. \n \nThird, the Article introduces and develops the “anti-entrenchment” principle. When the government seeks to entrench its power through funding decisions, the anti-entrenchment principle is triggered. Applying the anti-entrenchment principle can have far-reaching consequences, for it may require the government to subsidize precisely the speech it rejects.", :year 2021, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "American Journal of Comparative Law", :volume ""}, :authors [{:authorId "117425886", :name "Adam Shinar"}]} {:paperId "b309446c52c28953238f6e8b37885075d91425ea", :title "Illiberalism and Authoritarianism in the American States", :abstract "Federalism contemplates subnational variation, but in the United States the nature and significance of that variation has long been contested. In light of the recent turn, globally and nationally, toward authoritarianism, and the concurrent sharp decline in public support not merely for democracy but for the philosophical liberalism on which democracy rests, it is necessary to discard or to substantially revise prior accounts of the nature of state-to-state variation in the U.S. All such accounts implicitly presuppose a common commitment, across the political spectrum, to the core tenets of democratic liberalism, and consequently that subnational variations in policy preferences and modes of self-governance reflect nothing more than disagreements within the shared American liberal tradition. That assumption, if it was ever valid, may be no longer. As in other federal states in which subnational “illiberal enclaves” have persisted over time, the United States may be witnessing a replication at the subnational level of what appears to be happening at the national level: a growing chasm along a cleavage between democratic liberalism and illiberal authoritarianism, in which some states remain committed to inherited forms of democratic liberalism while others cling to (or develop, or resurrect) patterns of illiberal authoritarianism. \n \nThe paper examines both the “large-C” formal constitutions of the states and their “small-c” informal constitutions and behavior for evidence of such a development.

The authors claim that electoral politics in Africa since 1990 have been marked essentially by political continuity—for both good and bad. Multiparty elections are an element of continuity, “as once countries started to hold multiparty elections they continued to do so,” but the democratic gains are not yet observable inmost countries, and we still find the same political class as well as pervasive clientelism. The stasis in political life is striking, given the dramatic social and economic changes the continent has experienced in the last three decades. So “why has the move to routine and regular multiparty elections not promoted more political change in Africa? And why did it not generate democratic consolidation?” The authors argue that twomain factors account for the limited impact of multiparty elections in Africa. The first is presidentialism, namely the presence of strong presidents with enormous influence on how electoral politics unfold. The second is the liability of newness, that is, the fact that almost no African countries had had significant experience of multiparty elections before the transitions in the early 1990s. Thus, moving beyond pessimistic or optimistic appraisals of the nexus between elections and democracy in Africa, the authors define elections as “brief periods” during which political change—either toward democratic progress or backsliding—is more likely to occur. The book’s interesting findings draw on hundreds of elections, survey data, newspapers, and case studies. Starting with a path dependent argument to show the surprising importance of founding multiparty elections for political dominance and to explain the very limited alternation over time, the authors then explore the multiple mechanisms used by presidents to win elections.

Chief amongst the things it discusses is the rather central ethical issue of whether resisters may themselves, in their attempts to prevent a further erosion of democracy, transgress democratic norms. But the argument advanced in the article is not merely about the ethics of resistance. It begins, perhaps unconventionally, by addressing the affective dimension of resistance to democratic regressions, looking in particular at the powerful feelings of anger and despair that pro-democratic citizens living under a regressive government are likely to experience.

We demonstrate that resilient constitutional courts are products of an institutional framework, which prevents court-packing by loyal allies of populist leaders, and of courts’ activities that increase their reputation with the public, thus making political attacks against them overly costly. We argue that the Czech Constitutional Court has exercised an approach of selective judicial activism that focuses on keeping political competition fair while avoiding involvement in controversial socially transformative judicial decision-making which would outrage large parts of the population. Moreover, by acting as a guardian of fair political competition, the Court contributed to the further fragmentation of the political landscape, which in turn prevented the accumulation of political power, and hence the Court shielded itself from political attacks.", :year 2021, :openAccessPdf {:url "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/13642987.2021.2003337?needAccess=true", :status "HYBRID"}, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "The International Journal of Human Rights", :pages "1230 - 1251", :volume "26"}, :authors [{:authorId "2075661062", :name "Hubert Smekal"} {:authorId "90736007", :name "J.

Law has not been central in studies of democratic backsliding, but it has not been completely absent either. In the mid-2010s, scholars––mostly from political science and constitutional law––began tracing the links between legal norms/institutions and the degeneration of democracies in countries such as Venezuela, Hungary, Turkey, Russia, and Ecuador. These studies found that law had become central to the toolkit used by leaders with autocratic dispositions to undermine liberal democracies from within, while cloaking their moves in legal forms. Corrales called this practice ‘autocratic legalism’; Scheppele elaborated on this notion and popularized it in the law and society community. In 2019, a group of scholars from Brazil, India, and South Africa created a project to investigate the antidemocratic uses of law across the Global North–South. In homage to Scheppele, they labelled this the Project on Autocratic Legalism (PAL). This special issue reports on initial findings from PAL. The articles herein accomplish three remarkable feats: 1) they, of course, provide a rich body of data on the countries studied, including some where the relationship between law and anti-democratic politics has been relatively neglected; 2) they expand and enrich the analytical and methodological framework for studying such a relationship, and 3) very importantly, they challenge the existing geopolitics of knowledge on issues of law, democracy, and democratic backsliding.

Comparativists examining the contemporary United States initially highlighted the risks of populist leadership (i.e., political agency), stressed the possibilities of democratic backsliding, and examined how popularly elected chief executives can undermine democracy from the inside—all of which fueled grave concerns. Yet for a more realistic assessment of populism's actual danger for U.S. democracy, one must analyze the probability of such a deleterious outcome. Therefore, researchers need to embed agency in contextual conditions and investigate what institutional, structural, cultural, and conjunctural factors empowered populist leaders to destroy democracy in some countries, whereas other constellations of these factors have impeded democratic backsliding in many other nations.

To contribute to the answer, this article compares two divergent cases in the Asia-Pacific – “executive aggrandizement” in the Philippines and a “promissory” military coup in Thailand. An institutional explanation focused on remaining electoral, state institutional, and civil societal forms of democratic accountability despite autocratization does not elucidate significant variations in pushback. In the Philippines, elections have been fairer, state institutions less obviously manipulated and restrictions on civil society less overt. But opposition pushback has been significantly weaker than in Thailand despite more generalized repression and institutional manipulation there. An alternative explanation examines how opposition pushback is influenced by regimes’ efforts to legitimize autocratization. Thailand’s military-monarchical rulers had little success in framing recent elections as democratic while legitimacy linked to the monarchy has also eroded. This has catalysed the formation of a broad civilian opposition alliance, with strong parties, regular protests and critical social media. By contrast, while the Philippines’ Rodrigo Duterte acts illiberally, he claims continued democratic legitimacy based on competitive elections and high opinion ratings while ruling largely constitutionally.

He unravels hitherto undertheorized aspects of democratic backsliding by combining 20 indices and constructing an original index to classify 45 countries into open, fairly open, opening, suppressed, and closed societies. As the author notes in the preface to the volume, such an approach may seem “unthinkable” and risky but—and here I concur with Andjelic—the exercise may be quite useful analytically as, so far, scholars of the Western Balkans have not compared antiliberal trends across Europe. Indeed, we know that everywhere the pandemic has been instrumentalized by various populist politicians, interested in undermining liberal democracy and maintaining their grip on power. As Andjelic observes, the public health crisis only “accelerated and strengthened tendencies and trends that were already present and developing before the virus spread” (1). In this sense, the pandemic resembles a critical juncture, an extraordinary historical episode, that temporarily disrupts politics-as-usual across Europe in several unusual and worrisome ways. First, as the author pertinently notes, governments across various political regimes adopted anti-Covid-19 policies, which often infringed on human rights, weakened democratic processes, and abused individual freedoms for the sake of public health. More open societies experienced the same pressures as authoritarian states and, perhaps unsurprisingly, the author highlights the absence of any correlation between authoritarian tendencies and the suspension of democratic principles during the crisis (29–33). Next, it seems that everywhere legislatures and judiciaries either suspended or surrendered their prerogatives to the executive branch, a process which, combined with the war-like rhetoric accompanying the new public health measures, eroded well-established democratic practices. Moreover, as Andjelic remarks, the pandemic has undermined the neoliberal Comp. Southeast Europ.

Setiawan and Dirk Tomas (review)", :abstract "In 1962, following President Soekarno’s adoption of the “Guided Democracy” principle three years earlier, the noted Indonesianist Herbert Feith published a book titled The Decline of Constitutional Democracy in Indonesia. In it, Feith asked the question “why has parliamentary democracy failed in Indonesia?”. His fellow Indonesianist, Harry Benda, however, criticized Feith for asking the “wrong” question, as he felt a more appropriate question was “why should democracy have survived?” in Indonesia. In a 1964 review of Feith’s book, Benda argued that democracy would never survive in Indonesia because Javanese feudalistic culture was still very much alive. Ken Setiawan and Dirk Tomsa’s book, Politics in Contemporary Indonesia: Institutional Change, Policy Challenges and Democratic Decline, addresses the perennial question about the fate and future of Indonesian democracy, particularly after Reformasi in 1998. In thirteen chapters, the authors provide readers with an encyclopedic overview of the many facets of contemporary Indonesian politics and society, including the electoral system, local government, the role of Islam, civil society and the media, public health, gender inequality, human rights, environmental politics and foreign policy. The book echoes a worrying opinion common among many Indonesianists, that the country is experiencing a democratic regression characterized by increasingly “illiberal” trends. To support this observation, some scholars have cited the rise of conservative Islamic politics, the restrictions imposed on opposition groups and the reduced protections for minority groups. What Setiawan and Tomsa have done differently in their book is to examine Indonesia’s democratic backsliding over a range of issues. The authors do so while standing firmly on their institutionalist perspective. Throughout the book, they illustrate how the institutional framework and design of Indonesia’s electoral and governance systems have contributed to the decline of democratic values and practices. In Chapter Three, on Indonesia’s political institutions, for instance, the authors explore the decision to elevate the threshold for political parties to field presidential candidates.

Institutions enable the aggregation of preferences. Agenda-setting powers in committees, legislatures, and political parties, for example, help prevent cycling among decision makers. Institutions also aid in the solution to the problem of time inconsistency.Without the institutional capacity to delegate or tie one’s hands, societies would be stuckwith suboptimal outcomes. Independent central banks and courts, for instance, enable leaders to make credible commitments. Institutions in democracies allow for the solution of a range of problems so that democracy can “run better.”Theproof is to be found in the fact that democracies, on average, produce better outcomes: higher economic growth, better welfare for citizens, and fewer wars (e.g., Russett 1994; Sen 1983). In short, institutions make democratic governance possible. Both the third wave of democratic transitions in southern Europe and Latin America in the late 1970s and the fourth wave in eastern Europe, Africa, and Asia after the fall of the Berlin Wall seemed to corroborate the scholarly consensus.

Commentators have used descriptions like “authoritarianism”, “electoral autocracy”, “ethnic democracy” and “totalitarianism” to understand the current moment in Indian history. The framework of “autocratic legalism” illuminates the dynamics of centralization of power but there are also elements in the Indian experience that complicate this framework and reflect potentially unique features of the country’s democratic decline. These features can be attributed to the political rise and entrenchment of the Hindu nationalist ideology, profoundly facilitated by the electoral dominance of the Hindu right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party and Prime Minister Narendra Modi since 2014. This article argues that India’s spiral towards authoritarianism is also characterized by a range of disturbing and insidious developments beyond the centralization of state power, which are more concerned with majoritarian power seeping into everyday legality. The article considers three examples of such majoritarianism in everyday legality: the use of “anti-terror” laws against minorities and political opponents, policies driving towards the dispossession of minority citizenship, and the mobilization of the mob in ways that blur the lines separating the state from Hindu nationalist actors. These examples demonstrate how in India, autocratic forces are not merely interested in undermining (meaningful) democracy—all in the name of democracy. Instead, autocracy flourishes as a diverse and relatively disaggregated set of actors undermine democracy in the name of an ostensibly truer, Hindu, Indian nationhood.", :year 2022, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes ["JournalArticle"], :journal {:name "Verfassung in Recht und Übersee"}, :authors [{:authorId "12161775", :name "M.

Faced with economic or security crises, democratically elected executives in Latin America, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and Africa have used their popularity to push for legislation – particularly constitutional amendments – that, over time, destroys systems of checks and balances, hinders free and fair elections, and erodes political rights and civil liberties. Across the world, these heads of government have found ways to subvert democratic norms while simultaneously maintaining a democratic façade. Using and abusing elections and institutional reform, they are turning new and old democracies alike into competitive authoritarian regimes. Throughout the second half of the twentieth century, Venezuela was one of the most stable and prosperous democracies in Latin America. It had regular elections, strong institutions, and more wealth than any of its regional counterparts. Unlike other countries in the region, it did not succumb to right-wing dictatorships or protracted guerrilla warfare. Venezuela had forty years of democracy when Hugo Chávez was elected in 1998. Once in power, Chávez introduced constitutional amendments that strengthened his hold over congress, courts, and oversight agencies, and extended his time in office. He used that power to distort the electoral playing field to such an extent that it became almost impossible for the opposition to defeat him. In twenty years, Venezuela went from being one of the most promising democracies in the continent to one of its most egregious authoritarian regimes. Not all countries, however, have suffered this fate. In Colombia, Alvaro Uribe tried to erode democracy but failed. In line with the Chavista playbook, between 2002 and 2010, Uribe introduced constitutional amendments to undermine the independence of the legislature and the courts, enhance the powers of the executive, and extend his time in office.

Edited by Gabriel Marcella. 163 pages. Frank Cass Publishers, Ilford, England. 1994. $35.00 clothbound. $19.50 paperback. This slim volume is the most important book on civil-military relations specifically related to Latin America to appear in recent years. Edited by Gabriel Marcella, a Third World studies professor at the US Army War College, Warriors in Peacetime grew out of the December 1992 Inter-American Defense College Conference. Within the Americas' democratic revival context, it links related notions of what soldiers, suddenly at peace, do within US policy toward the region. The collection's strength lies in raising the right questions, which more than justifies the book's purchase. Warriors in Peacetime does suffer from an inability to weave tightly its two central themes: the Latin American armed forces' role in the democratic societies marking the region in this post-Cold War era; and the ways US Armed Forces should interact with their Latin American comradesin-arms to strengthen democratic civil-military relations. Both are pronounced North American policy goals. Despite this, both themes stand out. The articles by Marcella, Juan Rial and Richard Millett clearly address the first theme and not entirely optimistically. Marcella points out some difficulties developing appropriate armed forces roles during declining budgets and low-threat perceptions. Rial notes civil-military relations have not moved nearly as far as the democratic transition suggests. Finally, Millett points to the \"backsliding\" on democracy represented by the successful 1991 Haitian coup, the Venezuelan and Argentine 1992 coup attempts and Peruvian President Alberto K. Fujimori's 1992 autogolpe. US policy issues range from Kenneth Sharpe's North American drug policy critique; through Howard Wiarda's guided tour of human rights and democracy policy development to Jack LeCuyer's discussion of military policy tools, with emphasis on military engineers and nation assistance; and Ambassador Cresencio Arcos' articulate analysis of Latin American democracy problems and defense of current US policy. Sharpe's piece argues that North American drug policy is counterproductive to its Latin American democracy goals. Although he may be right, it is for the wrong reasons. As Ambassador Edwin Corr stated in his commentary on Sharpe's presentation, the US government never did devote the funds needed to support its drug war on the supply side. …", :year 1996, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "Military review", :pages "111", :volume "76"}, :authors [{:authorId "95862162", :name "J.

It focuses on the policies associated with Operation Bootstrap, such as birth control and migration campaigns, which sought to maintain control over the Puerto Rican labor pool. This piece argues that the term “modernization” disguises the extractive relationship between the U.S. and Puerto Rico, as well as the ways these projects weaponized race, class, and gender to sustain this imperialist framework. It also unpacks how narratives of “overpopulation” were a way to erase the role of colonialism by creating social and economic disruption on the island, and instead placed blame on Puerto Rican reproduction. Abstract In this research, I examine how modern and avant-garde artists in China engage in political commentary under the authoritarian regime. I found that artists use three primary methods: direct critique, metaphors, and cosmopolitanism. Using Ai Weiwei as a case study, I found that direct critique is the most effective method of political commentary, as it inspired public mobilization, received a heightened threat response from the government, and even altered the state narrative. I further explored the topic to discuss the effectiveness of artists’ sphere of influence, and I argue that the artist is most successful under a loyalist sphere as opposed to the globalist sphere. Looking at artists under a government regime where freedom of expression is limited, my research offers insight into the strategic choices of artists to engage in activism. Abstract In a world increasingly reliant on technology, cybersecurity engineers can scarcely keep up with the demand of emerging threats. Democracies such as the United States have learned year after year that malicious foreign governments can and will expose the flaws in the systems that allow democracy to flourish, and yet, solutions are few and far between. Autocracies like Russia use tools of virtual reality to exploit civil liberties, such as free and fair elections and the right to free speech. Russia has long been a threat to democracy, but this paper aims to explain how Russia’s history of democratic backsliding created an environment conducive to President Putin’s consolidation of power and subsequent manipulation of foreign countries through cyberwarfare. Abstract In the last two decades, China has made substantial efforts to combat childhood malnutrition, decreasing the childhood stunting rate by more than 50 percent. Despite the progress, data suggests that the urban-rural disparity remains an obstacle in delivering health equity, with obesity rates also on the rise. While the government and other non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have created several nutrition intervention programs in the past, none of them targeted preschool-aged children besides a few county-level experiments. Therefore, a new program should be created to provide nutrition support for children three to six years old. This program will request funding from the central government to recruit NGO workers to participate in nutrition education and direct nutrition intervention. The program will distribute nutrition supplements and educational materials through kindergarten programs and local clinic networks. In this way, the program will guide rural children to develop healthy eating habits that will benefit them for life. Abstract This comparative study seeks to explain the effects of different colonization methods on present-day economic affairs in former West African colonies. I seek to compare French “direct rule” which prioritized forced assimilation, and British “indirect rule” which focused on utilizing existing indigenous institutions. I will answer the question of how these different methods of colonial rule impact economic conditions in both formerly British-colonized Ghana and French-colonized Côte d’Ivoire. In explaining the economic development of Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire, my analysis on colonial systems in their former colonies concludes that the British method of indirect rule created a better economic forecast when looking at factors such as capital investment, capital flight, and the strength and flexibility of economic institutions. Such a comparative analysis seeks to establish the long-lasting effects of colonial legacies in formerly colonized nations. Abstract As Greece enters its second decade of debt crisis and depression, hindsight reveals that austerity— offered in 2010 as the cure for unsustainable debt—has impoverished the country and worsened its debt burden. In this paper, I argue that while popular analyses of the crisis conclude that austerity failed, the more meaningful takeaway from the Greek debt crisis is that no policy response could have succeeded. The macroeconomic models which inform modern policymaking neglect the influences of capitalism and the people on the acceptable range of policy options and thus cannot provide solutions for all crises as Keynes once hoped they would.", :year 2022, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal nil, :authors [{:authorId "2164483092", :name "Elizabeth Cady"} {:authorId "153584259", :name "Lillian Jones"} {:authorId "2166029373", :name "Vera Rousseff"} {:authorId "15930004", :name "E.

Since the beginning of the transition, the implementation of political and economic reforms in Serbia has been characterized by frequent shifts of periods with modest progress in the field of political and economic transformation with periods of stagnation and even backsliding in regards to the important reform segments. The indicators of political and economic reforms point to the strengthening of extractive institutions. Extractive institutions protect the economic and political interests of privileged groups to the detriment of the rest of society. This leaves fewer resources available to stimulate economic growth and job creation, with negative countereffects on the regime legitimacy and trust, which are crucial for the implementation of economic reforms. Serbia's failure to provide stronger economic growth is largely caused by extractive institutions that determine the business environment. The development of extractive institutions is indicated by the absence of a more even distribution of political power, weaknesses in the mechanisms of checks and balances, deficiencies in the sphere of the rule of law, widespread corruption, problems in the sphere of protection of property rights. The transitional developments in Serbia can be regarded as a historical heritage that adapts to the current social environment and has a great impact on institutional performance and democratic consolidation. Prolonged exposure to extractive institutions creates a cumulative effect of institutional learning, where individuals become vulnerable to political abuse, dependent on the state and unwilling to use political mechanisms of government accountability, contributing to a vicious circle of extractive political and economic institutions. Identifying the mechanisms of such accumulation, which include prolonged exposure to extractive institutions, as well as the transmission of cultural patterns from older generations who have long experience with extractive institutions, is a complex research task.", :year 2021, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "Zbornik radova Pravnog fakulteta Nis"}, :authors [{:authorId "82984244", :name "Natasa Golubovic"} {:authorId "108031970", :name "Marija Džunić"}]} {:paperId "bbc58cd6009c53b58eebb2a66a547dcf3bcdd15c", :title "A reply to Sujit Choudhry’s ‘Resisting democratic backsliding’: Weimar legacy and self-enforcing constitutions in post-WWII left-wing constitutional theory", :abstract "Abstract: As claimed by Sujit Choudhry, ‘historical examples have re-emerged as important elements not only of academic analysis, but also of constitutional practice’ worried by the threat of democratic backsliding.

Inherent in such \"delegative democracies\" is a risk of backsliding into authoritarianism.

History provides compelling insights. First, short-term economic crises are often the proximate trigger of regime change. Second, economic growth under autocracy does not lead to political freedom, but the robust middle class that generally emerges as countries become more prosperous can prevent backsliding to authoritarianism once democracy is established. Third, the promise of political freedoms raises people’s expectations for material opportunities, so failure to deliver on these expectations makes a return to authoritarianism more likely. The transition from authoritarianism to democracy is notoriously difficult. Many countries that were at one time budding with democratic promise now appear mired in political infighting; others are trapped in downward spirals of poverty and unemployment. Substantive democracy, characterized by majority rule with strong minority and civil rights protections, comes only slowly for most transitioning countries. As reformers in countries around the world struggle to consolidate fragile democratic possibilities, and as the international community tries to support them, gleaning policy-relevant insights from the trajectories of other democratic transitions is now more important than ever. In order to distill practical lessons for policymakers and reformers, this article looks carefully at the statistical evidence and at landmark country transitions that occurred over the past 25 years—Brazil, Mexico, Indonesia, Thailand, Poland, Ukraine, and South Africa—with a diverse range of experiences and outcomes. The evidence from the case studies and the statistical research helps clarify why some democratic transitions have succeeded while others have stumbled, and reveals several important insights.

One major concern is democratic backsliding, regression, or the rise of “illiberal democracies.” Another concern, closely related, is the rise of “populism,” at least in certain forms, such as those that are fundamentally anti-pluralist and view the “people” as a “moral, homogenous entity whose will cannot err,” or, in less virulent form, those that express impatience with institutional structures and norms -- such as judicial review, independent institutions, or separation of powers -- that stand in the way of direct, unmediated expression of the “popular will.” \n \nThis essay argues instead that the deepest and perhaps most enduring challenge to democratic governments across the West that has emerged in recent years is what I call “political fragmentation.” Put briefly, political fragmentation is the dispersion of political power into so many different hands and power centers that it becomes extremely difficult to marshal enough political power and authority for governments to function effectively. \n \nThe inability of democratic governments to deliver on the issues their populations care most about poses enormous dangers. At a minimum, it can lead to alienation, resignation, distrust, and withdrawal among many citizens. Worse, it can spawn demands for authoritarian leaders who promise to cut through the dysfunction of the political process. And at an even more extreme, it can lead people to question the efficacy of democracy itself and become open to anti-democratic systems of government. \n \nThe first part of this paper describes the ways in which political fragmentation is now affecting most Western democracies, and describes the different forms fragmentation takes today in proportional-representation political systems versus in first-past-the-post ones. \n \nThe second part analyzes the causes of fragmentation and asks whether this fragmentation is temporary or more likely to be enduring. This part argues that the communications revolution is a major cause of the political fragmentation of our era. The challenge the communications revolution poses to democratic governments is deeper than is generally recognized, because it goes beyond the now familiar issues of disinformation and conspiracy spreading (though these are serious problems). But the communications revolution might be thought almost inherently to undermine the capacity for legitimate, broadly accepted political authority – the authority necessary to be able to govern effectively in democratic systems. \n \nMost Western democracies are perceived by many of their members to be failing to address the major issues of the day. Political fragmentation makes it all the more difficult to do so.

This Special Issue draws together a field of scholarship that considers these extrajudicial dimensions of constitutional practice to reveal a very different constitution to the juridified version. It is a more complex, dynamic and pervasive vision of the constitution, focused on the ongoing relationships of a broader set of constitutional institutions and actors. These relationships are mediated by the legal and political dimensions of the constitution and by the narratives and symbolism that grow up around it. In this introduction, we explore three themes of the pervasive constitution: the importance of constitutional narratives and symbols, the multiplicity of constitutional actors and the relational nature of constitutionalism. This recalibrated understanding of the constitution reveals constitutional actors and power dynamics that are often invisible in more traditional accounts of constitutionalism. This recalibration is particularly important in addressing contemporary constitutional challenges. In settler systems hoping to decolonise, courts have proven important but insufficient sites of constitutional change, and it is in political spaces that new constitutional stories can be told, stories which acknowledge the full sovereignty of Indigenous peoples and their claim to territory.

Such challenges and threats are feeding an almost existential discourse about the crisis of democracy, and recent legal and political developments in Israel aimed at weakening the power of the Supreme Court and other rule of law institutions have also been described in such terms. This Article primarily intends to explore the relevance of the discourse surrounding the decline of liberal democracy, and its possible relevance for Israeli democracy, by examining the principal similarities and differences between specific legislative and administrative measures recently taken or contemplated in Israel and in two Central European states: Poland and Hungary. We focus on three sets of illiberal measures adopted or contemplated in Hungary, Poland, and Israel: (i) measures directed at limiting the power of the judiciary; (ii) measures intended to restrict the operation of civil society organizations; and (iii) measures directed at curbing dissent to governmental policies and at influencing the discourse in the media and academia. Although Israeli democratic institutions still retain much of their independence and vitality, we nonetheless find some degree of similarity between measures taken or contemplated by Hungary, Poland, and Israel, despite the many differences between their legal systems, historical contexts, political cultures, and the distinct stages of backsliding they seem to experience.", :year 2020, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "Law & Ethics of Human Rights", :pages "125 - 152", :volume "14"}, :authors [{:authorId "50643562", :name "M.

However, the country also endured severe shortages of energy and goods and swift deindustrialization in the 1990s, followed by severe decreases in GDP, industrial production, and employment, due to the Global Financial Crisis Despite these upheavals, the neoliberal policies at the heart of the Estonian political economy have remained remarkably intact, even over the course of eight parliamentary elections and sixteen cabinets. In Neoliberal Resilience, Aldo Madariaga, political scientist at Diego Portales University in Santiago de Chile, assesses the process by which neoliberal thought adapts to external shocks and thus continues to remain predominant in Estonia and three other case studies. At its core, Madariaga’s book convincingly argues that neoliberalism is most resilient when protected from representative democracy, even in the face of generally free and competitive elections. This requires narrowing the political space available to potentially anti-neoliberal policies and supporting the business sectors that gain most from neoliberal policies. Neoliberal actors can also resist majoritarian pressure by weakening their opposition by decreasing their political representation and obstructing alternative policies via constitutionally locking in neoliberal policies or otherwise imposing strict rules, such as instituting independent central banks or restrictive policies that can only be modified via parliamentary supermajority. This often comes at the cost of democratic backsliding and hollowed-out state institutions. This steep price is examined toward the end of his book, although the text would have been strengthened by a deeper discussion of how the inequality created by neoliberalism can drive populism, as the latter often draws support from promises to weaken neoliberalism’s hold on state power. This research is part of a recent trend among scholars exploring how neoliberalism is not simply a pejorative, or form of free market fundamentalism, but rather a set of ideas centered on legal arrangements using domestic power structures to create and defend markets and private enterprise from collective actors such as interest groups or the larger populace. Indeed, in his Globalists: The End of Empire and Birth of Neoliberalism (2018), Quinn Slobodian has argued that neoliberalism developed as a response to the rise of mass democracy. Neoliberalism does not so much ‘free’ markets as ‘encase’ economic policies, isolating them from the demands of popular democracy.

These developments imply a growing need (especially in the CEE countries) to find their own specific ways of dealing with both-systemic restructurings in social/political life, on the one hand, and intensifying feelings of distrust, uncertainty, and discontent, on the other hand.

In rising up against their governments, the peoples of the Arab Spring were confronting an age-old problem in political theory: when is it acceptable to rise up against an unjust authority? This question is not only of great importance to the peoples of the Middle East today, but was also of profound interest to the American founders and, through them, has informed the very basis of modern constitutionalism. It is perhaps unsurprising then that many constitutions themselves provide an answer to this question, allowing the people to challenge or overthrow their governments under certain circumstances. But to date, little systematic and empirical analysis has been done on the prevalence of this so-called “right to resist” in national constitutions, or on what motivates constitution-makers to adopt such a right. This article takes up the task. It presents a unique and original dataset on right to resist provisions in all national constitutions written since 1781, tracing its historical trajectory and demonstrating how it has proliferated in recent decades. The article moreover provides the first-ever empirical exploration of why it is, exactly, that constitution-makers give their people a constitutional mandate to overthrow or contradict their governing authorities – likely those very authorities elsewhere empowered by the same constitution. Drawing on a range of real-world examples as well as regression analysis, we show that right to resist provisions are most likely to be first established following a disruption of the previous constitutional order, either through popular democratic transition or through a violent political break such as coup d’etat. These findings suggest that the constitutional right to resist serves a dual function, depending on its context. On the one hand, the constitutional right to resist can represent a fundamentally democratic and forward-looking tool that constrains future government abuse, empowers national citizenry, and acts as an insurance policy against undemocratic backsliding. On the other hand, the right can serve as a backward-looking justification for coup-makers who seek retroactive legitimacy for whatever political crimes placed them in a position to be making a new constitution in the first place. Which of these two functions prevails may be in large part regionally determined. Latin American constitution-makers primarily adopted the right to resist in the aftermath of coup d’etats, while in other parts of the world the right to resist functions as a pre-commitment device against undemocratic backsliding. Our findings have significant implications for our broader understanding of constitutionalism. At the heart of any constitution, it is thought, lies a wish to bind the future on behalf of the present. Yet our findings suggest that, at least in some cases, constitutional provisions may also serve the function of reinterpreting and justifying the past. At least where the right to resist is concerned, constitutions are as much about yesterday as they are about tomorrow.", :year 2012, :openAccessPdf {:url "https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1429&context=public_law_and_legal_theory", :status "GREEN"}, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "Social Science Research Network", :volume ""}, :authors [{:authorId "2487499", :name "Tom Ginsburg"} {:authorId "1423470075", :name "Daniel Lansberg-Rodríguez"} {:authorId "104588439", :name "Mila Versteeg"}]} {:paperId "c2cefc6439b23bdfe254019bbe84f697a055b817", :title "“New normal” no more: democratic backsliding in Singapore after 2015", :abstract "ABSTRACT After the “watershed” General Elections (GE) in 2011, Singapore seemed primed for greater democratization. The ruling People’s Action Party (PAP) adopted a softer tone, and promised an expansion of the political space. Yet, after the subsequent GE in 2015, in which the PAP attained a much higher share of the votes in a resounding victory, there is an apparent democratic backsliding. Academics have been publicly censured by state leaders, legislation has been passed to strengthen the coercive capacity of the state, and dissenters have faced draconian measures. This paper investigates the reversal of democratization in Singapore, post-2015. I contend that after garnering a high level of political capital in GE 2015, the PAP reverted to its more familiar authoritarian stratagem. This was possible because of two main reasons: (1) the absence of a strong and coherent opposition which has enough credibility with the voters to cause a serious dent in the PAP’s electoral success; and (2) the absence of genuine reformers within the party to push through the agenda of democratization. Comparisons with Malaysia and the recent success of the opposition in a similar political system will be made.

This countered charges that activists were overly Westernised and supported their calls for ethical rule. Yet, after authoritarian rule gave way to democratic transition, liberals often turned against elected governments or were reluctant to challenge extremists who targeted ethno-religious minorities. In analysing these paradoxes, this article uses a contextualist rather than a stipulative, benchmarking approach that ignores contradictions in Western liberalism. Anti-majoritarianism in the Philippines and Thailand was driven by the fear that corrupt populists threatened religious-communalist values, with liberals ultimately turning against democracy. Another paradox is that in Indonesia, Malaysia and Myanmar liberals first used culturalist arguments to justify upholding civil liberties, but later became reluctant to criticise exclusivist forms of ethno-nationalism that endangered human rights. In the face of democratic backsliding in Southeast Asia, liberalism is being reconfigured, for instance through resistance by a middle-class youth movement against military-monarchical rule in Thailand, through multi-ethnic resistance to the 2021 coup in Myanmar, and by traditionalist Islamic groups in Indonesia.", :year 2021, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "Asian Studies Review", :pages "16 - 35", :volume "47"}, :authors [{:authorId "144651812", :name "M.

In many cases, rising levels of internal conflict, particularly ethnic conflict, have accompanied transitions from authoritarian rule to democracy.' The collapse of authoritarian regimes in Eastern Europe, Latin America, Africa, and Asia has resulted in a threefold increase in the number of democratic regimes around the world.2 Despite recent backsliding in a number of regions, major transitions to democracy continue to occur in pivotal states such as Indonesia, Nigeria, and Russia. At the same time, however, the world has witnessed a change in the nature of armed conflict, toward intrastate violence and ethnic conflict.

The author concludes that the cooperation of these external and domestic actors has led to the spread of democratic practices, creating what he calls ‘a spiral of democratization’ (p. 123). In the epilogue, written by Andrew Roberts, the author attempts to find the reason for the rise of populism and extremism in the region in the global recession and the interference of the European Union in domestic politics. Populist and extremist rhetoric is a reaction to these processes, arising in defence of the idea of national sovereignty. Roberts offers some suggestions as to how populism can be opposed: by strengthening the judicial system, increasing bureaucratic independence, and increasing the role of experts in the decision-making process. This book confirms that the process of de-consolidation of democracy in East Central Europe remains ongoing. This is a signal for the laggard countries in Eastern Europe and the Western Balkans that even successful transition countries can fall into the traps of populism, extremism, organised crime and corruption. The strength of the book is that the authors use an abundance of secondary sources (policy papers, academic articles, journal articles) written by local experts, which provide a lot of information about the political, social and economic processes in these countries not accessible to the researchers lacking the necessary language skills. This strength is, at the same time, the book’s key weakness, since the authors rely extensively on desk research, and original field research is very thin. Another weakness, incidentally common to many edited volumes, is the lack of a strong theoretical framework, which makes the connections between different chapters loose. The editors have tried to compensate for this by including two chapters discussing theories of transition, democratisation and consolidation of democracy at the beginning of the book, but this discussion is not integrated into the following chapters. The book is part of a growing wave of academic literature discussing the quality of democracy in Eastern and Central Europe after EU accession. This is a contribution that will serve scholars of the region well with its rich information sourced from local experts. It would be valuable if such a research included other post-communist countries, such as Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and the countries of the Western Balkans.

Today constituent power is, for that matter, an ex-post justification we ascribe to certain changes that occur in our legal systems. These changes used to be conceived as instances in which, as some claimed, norms were created in a god-like manner ex nihilo. They were willed into existence. The ex nihilo creation is a hallmark of traditional understanding of the role played by the concept of constituent power in constitutional theory. The unfetteredness of constituent power entails a danger of possibility that democratic states will backslide into authoritarian regimes where the citizens are treated as the objects, not the subjects of the state.The main claim of my dissertation is that the practice of constitutional and supreme courts indicates that the constituent power of free and equals cannot be understood as unlimited and that it should not be regarded as such in light of the theoretical justification I provide.Based on the practice of constitutional and supreme courts, the constituent power is not unfettered because there are principles and values based on which these courts strike down constitutional amendments. Courts declare the unconstitutionality of constitutional amendments which infringe upon certain principles and values that are claimed to be either sine qua non of a constitutional state governed by the rule of law, or belong to the fundaments of the constitution. Often these principles and values are not found among constitutional provisions. Moreover, the courts establish those limits regardless of whether such an authority has been provided to them by constitutional framers or without there being any substantive entrenchment provision on which the courts could ground their decision.I propose a theoretical account of constituent power that is limited. It is limited because its ultimate aim is creating a constitution which makes a claim to legitimate authority. Legitimate constitutional authority requires that the norms establishing basic procedures, institutions and substantive rules that claim authority over someone must be reasonably justifiable to them as free and equals endowed with human dignity. According to the theory I am proposing there exists a ‘core of constitutionalism’ which consists of normative presuppositions that condition how the constituent power of free end equals can be exercised. In my project I intend to argue that we can conceive of how and in what way the exercise of constituent power of free and equals produces constitutional law which makes claim to legitimate constituent authority.", :year 2015, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "", :volume ""}, :authors [{:authorId "47133934", :name "Bartosz Marciniak"}]} {:paperId "c4cca601b85ef45f7b3395d51601562dc55eff7e", :title "Democratic Backsliding and Public Administration", :abstract nil, :year 2021, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal nil, :authors []} {:paperId "c4ded8fc2c0d44164d9c84cf5d33e43bb63323de", :title "Challenges Facing Organised Interests Under a Populist Right-Wing Government in Slovenia", :abstract "The development of organised interests (OIs) during the socialist period in Central and Eastern Europe was considerably limited, if not frozen. This was also somewhat the case in Slovenia, where it was mainly OIs close to the government that could operate. In the early 1990s, the interest group system in the now independent country was already recognised as vibrant with the number of OIs growing each year ever since. Yet, Europeanisation processes in particular have led to additional opportunity structures being created for OIs to become involved in policymaking. The biggest obstacle to the development of such interests has become the low level of its professionalisation, given that most are run voluntarily. Around the end of 2020, the political environment for the activities of OIs remained quite favourable, with a few isolated drops in their public image and political attacks on mostly environmental organisations.

This included liberal OIs being publicly discredited, the obstruction of largely environmental OIs, and attacks on the media.

In the period that follows, either democracy survives and proves to be resilient, or an autocratic backslide occurs. In this article, we analyze the effect of NVR campaigns on the survival of democratic regimes. Building on the literature on modes of transitions and nonviolent resistance, we argue that those democratic regimes that come into being as a result of a NVR campaign are less prone to democratic breakdown. The main mechanism which produces this effect is that the organizational culture of NVR campaigns spills over to the subsequent democratic regime fostering conditions favorable for democratic survival.

However, it also resulted in the fragmentation of international affairs, the deterioration of constitutional democracy and a feeling of a growing shortage in democracy on national and international levels of governance. Trying to balance the impact of these two opposing trends, the author analyses the positive and negative effects of globalisation on constitutional development regarding such issues as transnational constitutionalisation, democracy and national sovereignty, the changing place of multilayer constitutionalism, the international separation of powers, and the system of global governance in the establishment of transnational constitutional democratic legitimacy. From this point of view, the populist backslide in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) looks dangerous and unforeseen, but it is a systemic and potentially predictable reaction of global regions on the uneven character of integration, the lack of democratic legitimacy and a new answer to the contortions and dysfunctions of global governance.

Polarisation has been a constant feature of Georgian politics, reaching new levels after the 2020 parliamentary elections. On the one hand, polarisation leaves little (if any) room in the political space for newcomers and small actors, including the far right. Carving out a niche in an extremely polarised political space requires a strong, consolidated, alternative force. To date, the fragmented nature of the Georgian far-right movement has hindered its mobilisation as a viable alternative to either the ruling party, Georgian Dream, or the opposition. On the other hand, the far right has also played a role in polarisation: Critics have argued that far-right groups have been used as an instrument to fuel polarisation further. Even though the activities of the far right seem to play into the interests of one end of the polarised political space more than the other, this article asserts that the far-right movement should not be reduced to a mere instrument in the hands of political powers. Introduction Since the early years of independence, political party polarisation has been a constant feature of Georgian politics. After the October 2020 parliamentary elections, it reached new levels. For several months after the elections, the opposition refused to enter the parliament and stood united against the ruling party, Georgian Dream, accusing it of rigging the elections and establishing single-party rule. In response, Georgian Dream blamed the opposition for destabilising the country and hindering normal political processes. Extreme political polarisation between Georgian Dream and the United National Movement (UNM), the largest opposition party, naturally limits the availability of political space for potential newcomers and smaller actors. Among the latter are far-right parties, some of which registered as parties ahead of the parliamentary elections in 2020 in an attempt to obtain access to institutional politics. Given that most votes went to Georgian Dream and UNM, however, their hopes did not materialise, even though a few other small parties did obtain parliamentary seats. However, some maintain that the far right has been not only affected by political polarisation, but also used as an  instrument to fuel polarisation further. Indeed, critics have pointed out that the street-level activities of the far right, most of whom are critical of the UNM, have sometimes served the ruling party’s interests. This article examines the role of the far right in political polarisation in Georgia. After a brief overview of polarisation in the country, this article discusses the influence of political polarisation on the far right, as well as the role of the far right in further polarisation. Even though the activities of the far right seem to play into the interests of one end of the polarised political spectrum more than the other, this article contends that the far-right movement should not be reduced to a mere instrument in the hands of political powers. Political Polarisation in Georgia For the past few years, Georgia has been one of the most polarised countries in Europe. Unlike many European states, however, polarisation in Georgia is not grounded in ideological differences: Most parties support a pro-market orientation and agree on a foreign policy oriented at EuroAtlantic integration (Nodia and Scholtbach 2006; Casal Bértoa 2017). Instead, polarisation takes place between the two major parties: the ruling party, Georgian Dream, and the largest opposition (and former ruling) party, UNM. Although polarisation is political rather than ideological, it exhibits similar characteristics to ideological polarisation and can be just as detrimental, if not more so. Research on polarisation has shown that polarisation may lead to stronger mass attachment to parties, which can be important for democratic consolidation (Lupu 2015). In other cases, however, polarisation can be damaging for the democratic process in general, intensifying debates, weakening the legitimacy of political actors and the entire political system, and contributing to democratic backsliding (Dalton 2008; Casal Bértoa 2017). If party blocs engage in antagonistic competition, elections turn into a choice between competing political regimes, and the political process can assume a ‘winnertakes-all’ logic (Enyedi 2016). In this process, the party that ends up winning an election assumes monopolistic qualities, questioning or even rejecting the division of power, and engaging in permanent confrontation with the opposition (Enyedi 2016). Since in the Georgian case, polarisation is not grounded in ideological party differences and is based CAUCASUS ANALYTICAL DIGEST No. 123, September 2021 4 on mutual rivalry between two political camps, it is debatable whether polarisation could produce potentially positive outcomes, such as stronger mass partisanship and the consolidation of democracy, as argued by Lupu (2015). Indeed, Georgian politics are based on a  ‘winner-takes-all’ logic. Each time a new ruling party comes into power, it overturns decisions made by the preceding government; for example, Georgian Dream nullified several decisions made by the UNM government, from symbolic ones, such as moving the parliament from the capital Tbilisi to Kutaisi, to development-related ones, such as the Anaklia deep water port project (Menabde 2021). Meanwhile, the opposition often resorts to contentious political practices, such as street rallies or parliamentary boycotts (Casal Bértoa 2017). Polarisation in Georgia is further exacerbated by personalised politics and the so-called ‘shadow godfathers’— political leaders who wield power from behind the curtain. Indeed, informal leaders of both Georgian Dream and UNM, including billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili on the one hand and the ex-president in exile Mikheil Saakashvili on the other, actively contribute to the radicalisation of politics (Casal Bértoa 2017; Freedom House 2020). The fact that both shadow leaders remain outside the system of institutional checks and balances only aggravates the problem, making Georgia vulnerable to democratic backsliding. What role does the far right play in this polarised landscape? On the one hand, political polarisation leaves little (if any) room in the political space for newcomers and small actors, including the far right, since both Georgian Dream and UNM frame their opponent as the enemy while framing themselves as the only viable option in the party landscape. On the other hand, the far right has also been used as a instrument to exacerbate polarisation. The following sections take a closer look at the Georgian far right and its relationship to the polarised political realm. The Georgian Far Right Despite increasing mobilisation over the past few years, the Georgian far right has not yet established itself in the electoral field. The only far-right actor that has managed to overcome the electoral barrier is the Alliance of Patriots (APG), founded in 2013 with an explicit aim to become a ‘third force’ in Georgian politics, in addition to Georgian Dream and UNM. The party obtained 5.01% of votes in the 2016 parliamentary elections, thus overcoming the 5% electoral threshold and becoming the only small actor to enter the parliament along with Georgian Dream and UNM. In the 2020 elections, held after the election reform that removed the 5% threshold, the party still managed to obtain seats in the parliament, but this time got a smaller share of votes at 3.14%. This could have resulted from vote splitting, as some far-right supporters opted for Georgian March and Georgian Idea (obtaining 0.43% and 0.25%, respectively), two former social movement organisations that registered as parties in 2020 to participate in the elections. However, these two actors failed to obtain enough votes to enter the parliament. The combined share of the vote for all far-right parties was 3.8%, which is still lower than APG’s share in 2016. With formal political participation mostly out of reach, the Georgian far right is mostly active on the streets and only has an indirect influence on political decision-making. Often, the far right aligns itself with the influential Orthodox Church to garner public support (for more information on the role of the Church, see Kandelaki). Street demonstrations usually involve not only the three parties of APG, Georgian March, and Georgian Idea, but also smaller, less formalised far-right groups such as the Society for the Protection of Children’s Rights. Notwithstanding, the movement hardly indicates consolidation and remains fragmented, despite occasional collaboration. a important recent development in the movement is Levan Vasadze, a long-term leader of the Georgian far-right movement, who formalised his political participation by establishing a political movement called ‘Unity, Essence, Hope’. He calls for the unification of far-right forces. To date, Vasadze has been met with lukewarm reactions from other far-right actors (Civil Georgia 2021b). In addition to street demonstrations, another form of far-right political participation is indirect involvement in decision-making. On several occasions, parliamentary parties, including APG, Georgian Dream, and UNM, have submitted legislative initiatives drafted by far-right actors to the parliament (Kincha 2020). Given that public opinion in Georgia echoes some nativist and homophobic ideas, it is perhaps unsurprising that major parties incorporate items from the far-right agenda, sidelining far-right actors themselves. Indeed, as public opinion surveys show (World Values Survey database n.d.), 61% of the population would not like to have a homosexual neighbour, and 83% think that homosexuality is never justifiable. Approximately 30% also object to immigrant neighbours or neighbours of a different race. In addition, 93% are proud to be Georgian, and", :year 2021, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes ["Review"], :journal {:name "", :volume "123"}, :authors [{:authorId "1506689041", :name "Tamta Gelashvili"} {:authorId "2145093679", :name "Salome Kandelaki"} {:authorId "118811346", :name "L.

Second, as opposed to Levitsky & Ziblatt (2018)’s three stage model of the backsliding – attacking referees, targeting opponents, and changing the rules of the game, we show that a pattern of changes in the constitution, in other words, changing the rules of the game, is the first step.

A central puzzle in this mode of backsliding is why these incumbents enjoy popular support despite their actions against democracy. We address this puzzle using the case of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. Although some Philippine analysts have speculated that his popularity was inflated due to social desirability bias (SDB) among survey respondents, there has been limited empirical examination. Our pre-registered list experiment surveys conducted in February/March 2021 detected SBD-induced overreporting at about 39 percentage points in face-to-face surveys and 28 percentage points in online surveys. We also found that the poor Mindanaoans, and those who believed their neighbors supported Duterte, were more likely to respond according to SDB. These possibly counter-intuitive results should be interpreted with caution because the survey was conducted during the height of the COVID-19 lockdown, and the findings cannot necessarily be extrapolated to the other period of his presidency. Nevertheless, this study suggests that preference falsification could be an alternative explanation for the puzzle of popular incumbents in democratic backsliding.", :year 2023, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes ["JournalArticle" "Review"], :journal {:name "Journal of East Asian Studies"}, :authors [{:authorId "2239858176", :name "Yuko Kasuya"} {:authorId "117599986", :name "Hirofumi Miwa"}]} {:paperId "caec8c20814ab70ea29cb83b6d1a0fae4db57c75", :title "Civic Education and Democratic Backsliding in the Wake of Kenya's Post-2007 Election Violence", :abstract "This paper examines two previously unexplored questions related to the impact of civic education programs in emerging democracies: 1) whether such programs have longer-terms effects, and 2) whether civic education can be effective in the context of democratic “backsliding.” We investigate these questions in the context of a large-scale civic education program implemented in Kenya between 2006 and 2007. The program ended just before the disputed 2007 election that sparked a wave of ethnic clashes that killed more than 1,000 people, displaced at least 350,000 from their homes, and brought the country to the brink of civil war. Data come from a survey of 3,600 respondents conducted in late-2008, about nine months after the violence. We test for program effects across a range of dependent variables, and find that the program did have longer-term effects, particularly on variables related to civic competence and engagement. It had less consistent effects, however, on core democratic values and orientations. These findings are consistent with previous studies of the short-term effects of civic education. Intriguingly, we also find that the program had positive effects related to Kenya’s post-election violence. Participants in the program who subsequently were affected by the violence were less likely (relative to non-participants who were later affected by the violence) to adopt negative beliefs about Kenya’s political system, less likely to support the use of ethnic or political violence, and more likely to forgive those responsible for the post-election violence.", :year 2010, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes ["Review"], :journal {:name "Law"}, :authors [{:authorId "3222455", :name "S.

It analyses democracy as a layered system consisting of three levels: the political/institutional, the social/interactional and the psychological/intrapsychic. At each level it uses evolutionary theory to describes features of a ‘light side’ of human nature that makes democracy possible, and of a ‘dark side’ of human nature that leads to democratic backsliding. At the political/institutional level these features are the reduction of reactive aggression and the capacity for the intragroup stranger. At the social/interactional level they are the cultural evolution of cooperative norms and an inclusive group identity. At the psychological/intrapsychic level they are the coherent, continuous positive self-experiences produced by shared positive emotions.

Departing from an observation that democratic practices have deteriorated significantly more in eastern European countries without mobilized ethnic minorities, this article argues for the central role of ethnic politics in buttressing democracy in the region. In countries with politically organized ethnic minorities, democratic institutions and practices remain more resilient. This is because mobilized ethnic minorities provide socially rooted electorates with almost an existential need for political rights and civil liberties.

Evidence from 14 Polish Surveys (2005–2021)", :abstract "Is elite or mass polarization the driver of the democratic backsliding? A number of recent papers in the political economy of backsliding have developed theoretical predictions about the eﬀects of polarization in the electorate as well as elite polarization on the process of democratic backsliding. However, when tested, these predictions focus on the polarization of political elites, typically within the same country. Cross-national data is ill-suited for the purpose of testing these predictions as we have no common yardstick against which to measure what is a “dangerous” level of polarization or how to compare countries that use diﬀerent electoral systems and, subsequently, have diﬀerent party systems and democratic institutions. Yet scholars for the most part have avoided even describing the emergence of mass polarization outside of the US. We oﬀer a longitudinal analysis of Polish public opinion data that anticipates the country’s downturn into authoritarianism by a few years to examine if polarization of the electorate preceded or followed the polarization of party elites. It focuses on a single, yet ultimately divisive issue—the costs and beneﬁts of EU membership—ﬁve years prior to accession and ﬁve years following joining the international organization.

They succeeded in subjecting the Western Hemisphere to quantitative limitations. There was a major tradeoff involved in the 1965 amendments which needed to be communicated. Hollifield is right that the United States is the primary reference point for Europeans, as well as the rest of the world, looking for guidance in international migration matters. And he correctly points out that the U.S. model is both a positive and a negative reference point. However, Hollifield's analysis of U.S. immigration policy could be clearer. He conflates Julian Simon's open borders advocacy with a left-leaning American perspective. He needed to explain more clearly that Proposition 187 did not represent a sea change in U.S. immigration history because Americans have always been ambivalent about immigration and its effects. He correctly notes how significant it is that a federal judge has blocked implementation of Proposition 187. Hollifield appears to conclude on a realistic, but somewhat pessimistic, note. He writes that immigration \"pressures will grow and obligate states to cooperate in order to control and manage [immigration] .... [N]o national or regional model has emerged with regard to integration of foreign populations which are numerous and continuing to grow.... A policy of control over ports of entry . . . will be necessary and will happen if there aren't international catastrophes.... It remains to be seen which of the democratic states is the best positioned on the political and cultural level to confront the challenges of immigration and integration.\" I concur that there is no single model to emulate. Americans, for instance, should study Australian, Canadian and West European immigrants policies closely. The 1995 and 1996 laws pertaining to terrorism, welfare and immigration in the United States did damage the U.S. model of legal immigration. But, at the risk of sounding chauvinistic or like Dr. Pangloss, there is little doubt in my mind that the U.S. approach is the appropriate model for emulation and that a U.S.-sryle legal immigration framework should become a foundation for an international regime regarding international migration. Moreover, the GECD-area states are moving in that direction despite political backsliding. Further progress towards international cooperation or international migration and consolidation of legal immigration frameworks is not inevitable. But major reversals would call into question democratic institutions and legitimacy. Most students of international relations anticipate expansion rather than contraction of democratic ideals and values in the post-Cold War period. This augurs well for progress in international cooperation on international migration despite the daunting obstacles. Progress will be contingent on perceptions of an acceptable level of control. Unfortunately, there is no incontrovertible way of measuring or assessing control due to the indeterminacy of illegal immigration. However, credible but nondefinitive evaluations can and will be made that should enable further progress.

Yet, since governance lies at the nexus of politics and administration, reforms limited to the administrative dimension are likely to fall short without concomitant political change. This essay argues that in contemporary Latin America, certain political-institutional arrangements or institutional traits are more likely to produce (in)effective governance than others. Specifically, Latin American presidentialism creates several “perils” for governance, including: the rigidity and short time horizons of presidentialism; multipartyism under presidentialism; weakly institutionalized party systems and non-programmatic parties; an imbalance of power between strong presidents and weak legislatures; the plebiscitarian nature of presidentialism; and democratic backsliding and the centralization of power in the presidency. These institutional traits incentivize patronage, promote myopic policymaking, and weaken bureaucratic autonomy.

This account is preceded by first outlining the general characteristics of Polish transformation since 2015 (in Part 1), and then explaining why the concept of “anti-constitutional populist backsliding” is the most appropriate way of characterising it (Part 2): it is “anti-constitutional” because it proceeds through statutory “amendments” and outright breaches of the Constitution; it is “populist” because the ruling elite is actively concerned to foment societal support and mobilisation, and it is “backsliding” because it should be seen against the baseline of high democratic standards already achieved in the recent past. After providing this account, I offer tentative explanations of the sources of PiS electoral success and then of its strong popularity in the society (Part 4), and in the Conclusions, I take a step back from the detailed account to offer more general observations about what the Polish case can teach us about the vexed question hotly debated in political sciences and constitutional theory these days, namely whether a “populist democracy” or “illiberal democracy” is still a democracy tout court.", :year 2018, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "", :volume ""}, :authors [{:authorId "92627583", :name "W.

A large-scale protest is generally associated with periods of massive political change. These mobilizations may spur democratization or enfranchise minority groups. While protests are crucial for providing a voice to the vulnerable and holding their government accountable to their citizens, there are possible downstream effects for the quality of democracy. Intensified protests are often followed by military coups or the emergence of radical populist leaders. Accordingly, radicalized protests are viewed as a danger to the legitimacy and stability of democracies. Despite the considerable social impact of protests, the mechanism of how protests would negatively affect the quality of democracy is highly understudied. In my dissertation research, I specifically investigate the relationship between protests and the polarization of the electorate, and I aim to explain how their confluence encourages democratic backsliding. My central argument --and finding-- is that protests serve as a focal event that may change voters' perceptions. In my dissertation, I seek to expand psychological approaches to mass polarization by theorizing and testing how protests targeting specific political parties or leaders may enhance individual partisan identities. Targeted protests provide open information containing a specific political message about targeted candidates or parties to the public. Accordingly, exposure to protests may activate and reinforces pre-existing partisan identities --including positive and negative-- and ultimately triggers affective polarization at the mass level. \"Affect\" refers to a psychological attachment to a group and is measured not only by the positive assessments toward the in-group (one's own party) but also by the negative evaluations of the out-group (the opposing party). In severely polarized societies, members become violently loyal to their \"team,\" waiting for it to win at all costs, and strongly biased or prejudiced against the other group. This individual effect may, in turn, increase the level of polarization at the aggregated level. To the study of the consequence of political protests on voters' perceptions, I incorporate a multiple-method approach combining a quantitative analysis as well as a qualitative case study of Brazil and multilevel cross-national analysis to bring a well-rounded analysis. In the first empirical chapter, I examine how a series of political protests accelerated public opinion's polarization in the Brazilian case between 2013-2018. In the second empirical chapter, I move from a collective level of opinion polarization to individual-level preference formation. I examine how exposure to targeted protests alters or reinforces the existing preference at the individual level utilizing the difference-in-difference identification strategy. Specifically, I analyze the period in which Jair Bolsonaro was elected in the 2018 presidential election. I examine how anti-Bolsonaro protests affected the vote choice by comparing the responses before and after the protest event. To do this, I utilize the wave of survey data from Datafolha conducted both a week prior to and after the massive protest event. In the last empirical section, I offer evidence that protests which targeted the government parties or leaders affect the voters' attitude toward the ruling party in democracies. Accordingly, targeted protests increase the affective polarization at the individual level in a cross-national context. I conduct a comparative study of public opinion polarization among 30 democracies between 1996 and 2018 using the public opinion data from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES). With these empirical analyses, I contribute to understanding the conditions in which protests may intensify the social conflict in democracies.", :year nil, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes ["Review"], :journal nil, :authors [{:authorId "49678970", :name "Yuko Sato"}]} {:paperId "d0b02f819845302a7fbc57bebb928d40c9cfe655", :title "The EU’s Crisis Response Regarding the Democratic and Rule of Law Crisis", :abstract nil, :year 2020, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "The Palgrave Handbook of EU Crises", :pages "627 - 646"}, :authors [{:authorId "69360633", :name "K.

Embedded from a historical perspective that spans the last three decades, we present two case studies of urban environmental mobilisation and identify ‘localization’, the reorientation towards grassroot activism, as a new trend driven by the closure of political opportunity structures. Localization combines with the alienation of protesters from institutional channels of influence-seeking and the weakening of ties with potential political allies, such as political parties or professionalised NGOs, and the increase of mistrust between the different actors.", :year 2022, :openAccessPdf {:url "http://real.mtak.hu/154214/1/EPSIGreenHungarycleangvfinalname.pdf", :status "GREEN"}, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "Environmental Politics", :pages "1267 - 1288", :volume "31"}, :authors [{:authorId "101416363", :name "A.

Each of these aspects of the region’s political development has engendered debate among scholars and activists. There is consensus that the experience of communism strongly circumscribed not only the possibilities for activism but also, in some instances, even the possibilities for articulating LGBT identities. Nevertheless, a survey of the scholarship on postcommunist LGBT politics indicates divergent trajectories between countries of the former Soviet Union, where LGBT identities are less established and activism is less organized, and the former satellite states of Eastern Europe, whose experience under communism was shorter and, arguably, less intense. Without ignoring the evident deficits of Eastern Europe’s LGBT activism in the 1990s, its LGBT people benefited relative to counterparts in the former Soviet Union from a generally more successful transition to democracy and a greater degree of exposure to West European institutions, in particular the EU. The process of applying for EU membership, many scholars argue, advantaged these countries’ LGBT movements vis-à-vis their counterparts in the former Soviet Union by pressuring national governments to be more accommodating and by socializing elites and publics to Western Europe’s comparatively tolerant values and LGBT rights norms. Adjusting to these norms was sometimes contentious, but several scholars argue that, where conservative backlash against LGBT rights occurred during the EU’s first round of expansion in 2004 to 2007, it generally helped domestic activism by increasing its visibility and level of organization.\n Not all are so optimistic about the EU’s impact on LGBT activism, however, particularly those studying Yugoslavia’s successor states, for whom the EU accession process occurred later or is still ongoing. These scholars emphasize the difficulties of squaring EU norms about LGBT rights with national identity, particularly given the EU’s sometimes colonial-like relations with postcommunist societies. Others note that transnational rights advocacy supported by the EU has been matched by the rise of transnational antigay activism, and that the clash of transnational activism stalemates domestic progress on LGBT-friendly policies. Such critiques appear increasingly relevant as trends of democratic backsliding have emerged since the 2010 world financial crisis in former “success cases” of postcommunist transition and EU integration, notably Hungary and Poland. The latter’s democratic backsliding occurs within the larger context of Russia’s reversion to authoritarianism after the brief political opening of the 1990s. Across these three countries, governing elites have shown a readiness to make use of LGBT issues to define their illiberal ideologies and to mobilize voters.

Analysis of longitudinal public opinion data reveals that the 2000– 2001 economic crisis undermined the democratic consensus, but that economic prosperity – far from restoring faith in democracy – reinforced support for a strongman leader as an alternative to liberal democracy among populations that benefited the most economically: the middle class and economic elites.

Second, this may not apply to populists in power, who may use emergency measures for democratic backsliding. Third, in the long-run, a potential economic crisis as a result of the pandemic may benefit populist parties, especially those in opposition as discontent voters may punish those in government for the poor managing of the health/economy trade-off.

Key findings include: • To address the COVID-19 pandemic, starting in March 2020, more than half the countries in the world (59 per cent) had declared a national state of emergency (SoE), enabling them to take drastic temporary (and in most cases necessary) measures to fight the pandemic. These measures have included in most cases temporarily curbing basic civil liberties, such as freedom of assembly and movement, and in some cases postponing elections. • International IDEA’s Global Monitor of COVID-19’s Impact on Democracy and Human Rights finds that more than half the countries in the world (61 per cent) had, by the end of November 2020, implemented measures to curb COVID-19 that were concerning from a democracy and human rights perspective. These violated democratic standards because they were either disproportionate, illegal, indefinite or unnecessary in relation to the health threat. • Concerning developments have been more common in countries that were already non-democratic prior to the pandemic (90 per cent) and less common, although still quite widespread, in democracies (43 per cent). • The democracies that have implemented democratically concerning measures are those that were already ailing before the pandemic. More than two-thirds were democracies that were either backsliding, eroding or weak prior to the pandemic. • Almost a year since the first outbreak of COVID-19, the pandemic seems to have deepened autocratization in most of the countries that were already non-democratic. However, in at least 3 of those countries (Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, Thailand), the pandemic has also tapped into existing simmering citizen discontent and may have been the tipping point in unleashing massive protest waves demanding democratic reform. The pandemic has also seemingly deepened democratic backsliding processes and exposed the democratic weakness and fragility of new or re-transitioned democracies (Malaysia, Mali, Myanmar, Sri Lanka). In a few cases, the pandemic has also exposed countries that showed no apparent sign of democratically ailing prior to the pandemic, but where concerning democratic developments have occurred during the pandemic and which risk seeing a significant deterioration in their democratic quality as a result (i.e. Argentina, El Salvador). • The aspects of democracy that have seen the most concerning developments during the pandemic are freedom of expression, media integrity, and personal integrity and security. However, the freedoms that have been restricted across most countries are freedom of movement and assembly. Another core democratic process that has been heavily affected by the pandemic is the electoral, with half the elections scheduled between February and December 2020 postponed due to the pandemic. • The pandemic has also shown democracy’s resilience and capacity for renovation. Innovation through accelerated digitalization has occurred across most regions of the world. And democratic institutions, such as parliaments, courts, electoral commissions, political parties, media and civil society actors, have fought back against attempts at executive overreach and democratic trampling or collaborated to ensure effective responses to the pandemic.

Key findings include: • Democratically, the region was ailing prior to the pandemic, with some countries suffering from democratic erosion or backsliding, others from democratic fragility and weakness. Overall, trust in democracy had been in steady decline in the decade preceding the pandemic. Citizen discontent has culminated in a protest wave hitting several countries in the region at the end of 2019. • The COVID-19 pandemic has hit a Latin American and Caribbean region plagued by unresolved structural problems of high crime and violence, political fragmentation and polarization, high poverty and inequality, corruption, and weak states. • Long-overdue political and socio-economic reforms have compounded the health and economic crises caused by the pandemic. This, coupled with heavy-handed approaches to curb the virus, risk further entrenching or exacerbating the concerning democratic trends observed in the region prior to the COVID-19 outbreak. • The challenges to democracy Latin America and the Caribbean during the pandemic include: the postponement of elections; excessive use of police force to enforce restrictions implemented to curb the pandemic; use of the military to carry out civil tasks; persistent crime and violence; new dangers for the right to privacy; increases in gender inequality and domestic violence; new risks posed to vulnerable groups; limited access to justice; restrictions on freedom of expression; executive overreach; reduced parliamentary oversight; political polarization and clashes between democratic institutions; new openings for corruption; and a discontented socially mobilized citizenry that rejects traditional forms of political representation. • Despite the challenges, the crisis ultimately provides a historic opportunity to redefine the terms of social contracts across the region, and for governments to think innovatively about how to open up spaces for dialogue and civic participation in order to build more inclusive, sustainable and interconnected societies, as well as more accountable, transparent and efficient democratic systems of government.

Based on a mixed-method content analysis, the main argument of the paper is that the rise of centrist technocratic populism (perhaps less radical at first glance) ends the era of the Czech Republic’s exceptionalism in Central Europe in terms of its resistance to populist illiberal challenges. In other words, the analysis shows that populism combined with technocracy (and not necessarily with more radical ideologies such as nativism) presents a vision of a regime alternative to the dominant liberal democratic paradigm.

Part 1 establishes the theory of the consolidation, while Part 2 applies it empirically by evaluating the effectiveness of electoral engineering at consolidating power. The main contributions of Part 1 are as follows: • The consolidation of power is a political, actor-focused concept that supplements the literature on democratization/democratic backsliding and is applicable as a foundation for empirical analysis. • The consolidation of power is defined as an action that meets four criteria: an actor that possesses power purposefully uses that power to increase its long-term influence or to preserve the power that it already has. • The classification of power consolidation is established using a parallel with the typology of democratic consolidation: positive consolidation increases power, negative consolidation preserves it, while neutral consolidation organizes and embeds it. • All three types of power consolidation are compatible with democracy, even though they often contribute the erosion of the quality of democracy. Nevertheless, the consolidation can sometimes even be necessary for the establishment/improvement of democracy. The main contributions of Part 2 are as follows: • Electoral engineering is an act when electoral reforms are motivated by partisan self-interest; parties create systems for their own electoral benefit, i.e. they would like to maximize their partisan bias (gain as many seats as possible for a given vote share). This is a widely accepted assumption in the literature that Part 2 intends to test empirically. • Using a novel dataset that covers each democratic election in the world between 1974 and 2017, this assumption is tested using various statistical methods (descriptive statistics, t-tests, OLS regressions, logistic regressions, and difference-in-differences analysis). • The first hypothesis posited that electoral reformers design systems that increase their partisan bias compared to their bias in the previous election. The analysis indicated no significant effect; hence the hypothesis was rejected. • The second hypothesis posited that electoral reformers design systems that are favorable to them compared to other parties (i.e. the partisan bias of reformers is higher than non-reformers). The analysis indicated no significant effect (only a minor benefit to neutral reformers and a minor detriment for proportional reformers in one of the models); hence the hypothesis was rejected. • The third hypothesis posited that electoral reformers design systems that increase their chances of reelection. The analysis indicated no significant effect; hence the hypothesis was rejected. • The fourth hypothesis posited that the direction of reforms, i.e. whether they make the system more majoritarian or more proportional depends on the direction of their popularity between the election or their partisan bias t the election preceding the reform. The analysis indicated no significant effect; hence the hypothesis was rejected.

It is important to reflect on the ways in which the pandemic has impacted the international politics of migration and especially on the migration-security nexus, which is still little understood but affecting policies and population movements with future implications. How the pandemic has shaped tradeoffs between securitization of migration, health, and economic concerns in governing migration? What are the new trends emerging from the pandemic on the migration-security nexus? And how can we study these in the coming years? This Research Note features insights from scholars associated with the British International Studies Association’s working group on the ‘International Politics of Migration, Refugees and Diaspora’. They argue that the pandemic has exacerbated tendencies for migration control beyond reinforcing nation-state borders, namely through foregrounding ‘riskification’ of migration discourses and practices, adding to an earlier existing securitization of migration considered as a ‘threat’. Digital controls at borders and beyond were ramped up, as were racial tropes and discrimination against migrants and mobile persons more generally. These trends deepen the restrictions on liberal freedoms during a period of global democratic backsliding, but also trigger a counter-movement where the visibility of migrants as ‘key workers’ and their deservingness in host societies has been enhanced, and diasporas became more connected to their countries of origin. This Research Note finds that enhanced controls, on the one side, and openings for visibility of migrants and transnational connectivity of diasporas, on the other, are worthy to study in the future as political trends per se. Yet, it would be also interesting to study them as interconnected in a dual movement of simultaneous restriction and inclusion, and in an interdependent world where the power of nation-states has been reasserted due to the pandemic, but migrant transnationalism has remained largely intact.", :year 2023, :openAccessPdf {:url "https://academic.oup.com/migration/article-pdf/11/1/242/49455817/mnac039.pdf", :status "HYBRID"}, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "Migration Studies"}, :authors [{:authorId "67343199", :name "M.

In the course of the research, the following hypothesis is verified: in the face of the COVID-19 epidemic in Poland, attempts by the ruling elite to change the provisions related to organizing the presidential elections scheduled for May 10 are an example of democratic backsliding, which, by weakening democratic institutions, has threatened the constitutional provisions and the essence of the democratic system.", :year 2021, :openAccessPdf {:url "http://czasopisma.marszalek.com.pl/images/pliki/ppsy/50/ppsy202105.pdf", :status "GOLD"}, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "Polish Political Science Yearbook"}, :authors [{:authorId "2106282067", :name "M.

Weiler is a visiting assistant professor at Bowdoin University.In this article I explore two specific areas of human rights concern in contemporary Russia: violence against women and conditions in Russian prisons. As I explain below, these areas clearly do not exhaust the human rights problems facing Russia today. However, they do highlight a confluence of factors that are evident in many new democracies, and they are having profoundly negative consequences for socially vulnerable groups. Specifically, I argue that declining state capacity, fiscal austerity, and growing social inequality, characteristic features of many of the new democracies, translate into gross violations of the rights of socially vulnerable groups. Furthermore, although civil society development and its implications for human rights are not central to this article, I do argue that the kind of civil society 1 that may be evolving in Russia and other new democracies is not that characteristic of a larger liberal project in the historic Western sense, which among other things protects human rights. 2 Instead, it may be that the nongovernmental organization (NGO) model for civil society, now central to U.S. Agency for International Development democracy building and implicitly accepted by many scholarly accounts, is more conducive to what William Robinson and others view as a neoliberal project. Thus, rather than supporting democracy as a system in which citizens are empowered to effect change at all political levels and in which they have the power to defend their most fundamental rights, civil society may reflect accommodation to a political order in which \"a small group actually rules and mass participation in decision-making is confined to leadership choices in elections carefully managed by competing elites.\" 3 In other words, although an increasing number of citizens are involved in a growing NGO sector, civil groups remain unable to influence meaningfully larger questions of public policy, especially the overall shape of economic reform and social transformation, or to mitigate the increasing incivility of life in Russia. 4I do not intend to criticize the activities of NGOs themselves, and I will, in the discussion of human rights violations, comment on some of the impressive work that independent human rights activists are carrying out in Russia. As I discuss later on, the burgeoning activity of NGOs is having a positive impact on certain specific policy areas, especially in the prison system. However, in the face of widespread poverty, great economic inequality, and reduced social spending, 5 the proliferation of NGOs in Russia, including human rights NGOs, may be no more than a finger in the proverbial dike. 6 Particularly, as I will address in more detail below, the weakness of the Russian state, especially the dearth of material resources available to it, creates obstacles to the realization of human rights that no amount of civil society development, understood as the emergence of large numbers of NGOs, will be able to overcome.Scholars writing on Latin America have argued that the neoliberal project has yielded a proliferation of problems. 7 These include dramatic increases in income inequality and poverty; skyrocketing crime rates and attendant draconian crime-fighting policies characterized by an increase in incarceration and widespread human rights abuses; a criminalization of poverty; growing distance between ruling elites and masses; and an attendant cynicism about the responsiveness of authorities to popular concerns. In this article, I focus specifically on the human rights dimension of these problems. It is my contention that despite the development, however haphazard, of some form of democratic governance in Russia in the past ten years, human rights have suffered significantly. 8 Scholarly expectations about the relationship among democracy, democratization, and human rights are so strong, in fact, that there is only minimal consideration generally given to the possibility that once on the road to democracy, a state could experience a significant backsliding in the area of human rights. …", :year 2002, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "Demokratizatsiya", :pages "257", :volume "10"}, :authors [{:authorId "29180581", :name "J.

A prominent contemporary phenomenon is “backsliding” of democratic countries into (semi-)authoritarian practices.

Building on recent work (Svolik 2020), we present a model in which a government engages in a reform that may allow for subsequent actions that are inconsistent with the rule of law. Citizens must decide whether to replace the incumbent following the reform. Consistent with existing work, the model suggests that polarization is an important factor in democratic backsliding. More importantly, the model demonstrates that in a dynamic setting, citizens may support incumbent governments even if citizens are fundamentally opposed to authoritarianism.

Building on and advancing the theoretical framework of democratic backsliding and PRR party cooperation, this article assesses the impact of exogenous shocks triggered by external authoritarian actors on these types of collaborations. A detailed examination of the voting patterns of Fidesz, Law and Justice and other PRR parties in the European Parliament (EP) is undertaken, and their stances towards Russia and the RoL conflict before and after the invasion are weighed. The findings show that the invasion did not influence the dynamics of democratic backsliding. Despite the rhetoric, it actually brought Fidesz and Law and Justice closer together. While the attack led to a convergence of assertiveness towards Russia among the PRR parties, the Putin regime remains a divisive issue within the PRR family. The different positions towards Russia did not affect the support of PRRs for the backsliders.", :year 2023, :openAccessPdf {:url "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/01402382.2023.2202981?needAccess=true&role=button", :status "BRONZE"}, :publicationTypes ["JournalArticle"], :journal {:name "West European Politics", :pages "1178 - 1204", :volume "46"}, :authors [{:authorId "107787883", :name "Adam Holesch"} {:authorId "2373501", :name "P.

The insurrection was unexpected to the general public, did not coincide with other events that could plausibly affect public opinion, and occurred while Gallup was conducting a nationally representative survey using random digit dialing. Comparing Republican Party support among respondents that were interviewed just before, and just after, the insurrection occurred suggests that the insurrection caused a 10.8% decline in support for the Republican Party.

Even amid institutional backsliding in the early 21st century, most leaders assume office and claim their mandate via elections. However, in the face of significant governance challenges, reservations regarding democracy and democratic processes are on the rise. In 2014, 68% of individuals in the average Latin American country expressed support for democracy. Five years later, in 2019, that figure was 58%. Support for state-led redistribution declined during this period as well. In brief, there are signs that the public is moving away from a social democratic orientation.\n Generalizations about political culture risk overlooking significant heterogeneity in Latin American beliefs and inclinations. Survey data, especially from comparative projects, permit assessments of the region’s political culture across time, countries, and population subgroups. Analyses of these data paint an appropriately nuanced portrait of Latin American political culture. Support for core democratic values is highest in the Southern Cone countries of Uruguay, Argentina, and Chile. Support for democratic institutions and processes is far lower in countries that have experienced recent instability and governance challenges, including Honduras and Peru. In Latin America, the young tend to be less committed to democratic institutions and processes. Those in rural areas tend to be more inclined to engage in local politics. Those who are poor tend to perceive themselves as less capable of understanding key national issues. Finally, women tend to be politically more conservative.\n How people in the region believe politics ought to be organized and function—that is, political culture in Latin America—matters. This is because the public’s inclinations to express core democratic values and to engage in the system shape political outcomes. Where individuals lack confidence in the democratic state, they are less prone to support it. Further, they are more likely to issue demands, and to look for leadership, outside of formal political channels. The comparatively low and decreasing levels of support for democracy place Latin America at a crossroads. Failure to meet key governance challenges—corruption, inequality, crime—could accelerate declines in confidence and interest in participatory democracy, to the detriment of political culture and democratic consolidation in Latin America.", :year 2021, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes ["Review"], :journal {:name "", :volume ""}, :authors [{:authorId "21574191", :name "Elizabeth J.

While the elections were ostensibly competitive-11 parties on the ballot and four winning seats in the legislature-international observers, to the extent they were present, made contradictory judgements on the democratic credentials of the vote. Not surprisingly, those from the Commonwealth of Independent States approved the election, while the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) refused to send observers because the conditions offered by the Russian government were said to prevent them from doing a proper j ob. The Council of Europe, on the other hand, carried out its observer mission, concluding that while the elections were \"to a great extent free in terms of a variety of voting options, they were definitely not fair.\"3Problems with the election had less to do with overt fraud (although opposition forces made some allegations of that as well) but with restrictions on conditions preceding and surrounding the vote. These restrictions included selective enforcement of electoral laws in order to exclude some parties from participating, general crackdowns on critics of the regime, restrictions on public gatherings by groups opposing the government, and media bias. The Council of Europe made specific mention of \"abuse of administrative resources,\" as well as unequal media access, use of force against and harassment of opposition leaders, restrictive effects of electoral legislation, and voting improprieties on election day.3 In addition, pressure on voters to support United Russia was widely reported in the press, with allegations that school teachers, other state employees, and students were threatened with sanctions if they didn't vote \"correctly.\"4 In the larger context, many observers considered these actions unfavourable in democratic governance.Given the consistently high level of popularity of Vladimir Putin both preceding and following the election, and the availability of methods of informal influence over regional elites (who in turn have informal tools to influence the regional vote), the extraordinary methods applied in order to assure a high vote for United Russia seem puzzling. Some of these measures simply opened the door to further allegations about a slide toward authoritarianism, while being unlikely to affect the outcome in any significant way.This article explores possible reasons underlying the efforts of the Russian leadership to assure the election outcome and suggests some criteria for assessing their compatibility with democratic practice. The underlying argument is that the \"colour revolutions\" that took place in other postcommunist countries since November 2003, notably Ukraine's orange revolution, offered a powerful impetus for Russian elites to \"manage\" the 2007 Russian parliamentary election even more firmly than they had in 2003. No doubt other underlying factors reinforced this tendency, including Putin's own career background and personal inclinations, worries about terrorist attacks, cultural predispositions, the weakness of civil society, and \"legacies of totalitarianism.\" This analysis resists the temptation of falling back on these standard explanations, and assumes a rational calculation of interest on the part of the Russian leadership.BACKSLIDE FROM DEMOCRACY PRECEDING THE 2007 ELECTION?The 2007 duma elections should be viewed in the larger context of Russia's \"backslide\" from the democratization impetus that took hold in the Yeltsin years.

Studies dealing with these two countries’ EU accession have highlighted that EU membership was premature and found pre-accession expectations largely confirmed when looking at failures to implement anti-corruption policies, deficiencies in the use of rule of law or backsliding in democratic practices. This contribution takes issue with these pre-accession expectations in the literature and focuses on legal compliance with EU legislation as the most direct way to assess whether EU rules are followed or not.

Purported “developmental states,” such as Ethiopia and Rwanda, are argued to possess strong-willed, visionary leaderships whose commitment to delivering on ambitious development plans renders them attractive donor partners. These leaderships are also, however, often authoritarian and unapologetic when criticized for democratic backsliding or human rights abuses. For many Western donors this represents a tolerable trade-off. The purpose of this article is to interrogate, critique and explain the assumptions and ideas underlying this trade-off. Using the case study of Ethiopia, we argue that donor officials’ understandings of “developmental state” are varied, vague and superficial, the main commonality being a “strong” regime with “political will” and a non-negotiable approach to domestic governance. We suggest that donors have too readily and uncritically accepted, internalized and deployed these notions, using the “developmental state” concept to justify their withdrawal from serious engagement on democratic reform. This derives from a systemic donor preference for depoliticized development models, as well as from Ethiopian officials’ own savvy political manoeuvrings. It has also, however, weakened donors’ position of influence at a time when the Ethiopian regime is debating major political reform.", :year 2019, :openAccessPdf {:url "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/13510347.2019.1670642?needAccess=true", :status "HYBRID"}, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "Democratization", :pages "185 - 203", :volume "27"}, :authors [{:authorId "2122483463", :name "Stephen Brown"} {:authorId "48472593", :name "J.

At the same time, a surveillance-based economy and anti-democratic threats this poses have thrived. The coronavirus pandemic has enabled these trends, giving authoritarian leaders and surveillance capitalists the opportunity to make massive shifts and reprogramming of our sensibilities about privacy and civil liberties that may not be reversible. The author argues that judicial leaders and court administrators around the globe will need to readjust and adapt to the realities of governance in this new era of illiberalism. He recommends three key changes that courts and justice systems around the world may need to make to deliver justice in the face of the challenges: first, creating a new narrative, one that is less combative, one that aggressively eschews the past’s sharply polarized relationships between the judicial branch and the other two branches of government, and one that makes people partners instead of opponents; second, a new approach that puts major emphasis on good governance of the judicial branch, with a focus on competence and performance, an approach that mutes the more strident demands by judicial leaders for absolute judicial independence, coequal status of the judiciary with the executive and the legislative branches of government, and a perfect balance of power between them; finally, “going global” and linking up with international partners for global solidarity and collective action, thereby gaining influence and strength from international support back home.", :year 2020, :openAccessPdf {:url "https://storage.googleapis.com/jnl-up-j-ijca-files/journals/1/articles/339/submission/proof/339-1-1508-1-10-20200810.pdf", :status "GOLD"}, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "International Journal for Court Administration", :volume "11"}, :authors [{:authorId "3628652", :name "I.

To bridge this gap conceptually, I focus on elected executives’ efficiency in matching the intensity of policy tools to the intensity of policy problems, thus developing the Ladder of Disproportionate Policy.

Does this sympathy imply a logical congruence? Comparing theories of militant democracy and epistemic technocracy (aka epistocracy), I discover a common approach to basic aspects of representative democracy. Both theories see voters as fallible or ignorant instead of capable political agents; and they both understand political parties to be channels of state rule rather than democratic expression. This shared suspicion of grassroots political agency explains why they employ non-democratic means to pursue their goals. But the two theories appear to be also analytically co-extensive. Like militant democrats, epistemic technocrats polemicize antidemocrats inasmuch as the latter are proxies for epistemically foul decision-making. Conversely, militant democrats try to block ‘incorrect’ decisions as long as these lead to democratic subversion, thereby producing a distinct type of militant technocracy. The article ends by drawing the implications of this symbiosis of epistemic and militant democratic ideas for contemporary democratic theory.", :year 2020, :openAccessPdf {:url "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/13698230.2020.1782047?needAccess=true", :status "HYBRID"}, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "Critical Review of International Social and Political Philosophy", :pages "437 - 460", :volume "26"}, :authors [{:authorId "104571380", :name "Anthoula Malkopoulou"}]} {:paperId "de064c600faa9399d9b4575bf5958420bbbfd3cf", :title "An Overview of Israel's ‘Judicial Overhaul’: Small Parts of a Big Populist Picture", :abstract "Abstract In the comparative constitutional field relating to backsliding democracies, it is difficult to find an example of a single constitutional event that undermines the basic principles of democracy. Democracies die in a slow and gradual process. Each of the laws passed is not in itself fatal for democracy but when the measures are examined together, cumulatively, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. It is the big picture, the whole series of legal moves, that brings about a fundamental change in the state's regime until it is no longer a liberal democracy. In these situations of gradual erosion there is no single law that can reveal the magnitude of the change inherent in it. To understand the risk, it is therefore necessary to refer to its overall institutional context. The proposed reform in Israel may result in serious harm to the principle of separation of powers. Moreover, given the importance of imposing limits on governmental power as a tool for protecting human rights and the ‘rules of the game’ in democratic regimes, the reform would seriously harm the protection afforded to these rights and principles, and constitute a clear and present danger to Israel's liberal democracy.", :year 2023, :openAccessPdf {:url "https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/4E80EFB10DC617A66F898C64E20ECA1B/S0021223723000262a.pdf/div-class-title-an-overview-of-israel-s-judicial-overhaul-small-parts-of-a-big-populist-picture-div.pdf", :status "BRONZE"}, :publicationTypes ["JournalArticle" "Review"], :journal {:name "Israel Law Review", :pages "482 - 501", :volume "56"}, :authors [{:authorId "113819462", :name "Suzie Navot"}]} {:paperId "de4c23ca2b0b901686288d8eac3e509a72935831", :title "DEMOCRACY OVER A BARREL: OIL, REGIME CHANGE AND WAR", :abstract "Will autocracies dependent on the export of oil become democratic? To some, the answer seems evident. “The trend is clear,” President Bush said in March 2005. “In the Middle East and throughout the world, freedom is on the march.” Unfortunately, at least in the near term, the opposite is true. Not only is the worldwide spread of democracy stagnating in general, but a number of countries that had once demonstrated some progress are seriously backsliding. By my calculations, about a third of these backsliders are oil-exporters, perhaps most notably Russia. And not a single oil-exporter currently classified by Freedom House as “not free” or “partly free” shows signs of changing its status to democracy.

The main argument is that democratic backsliding in Southeast Europe is deeply rooted in the unfinished transitions of the 1990s, which gave rise to new political and economic elites and that blending those two into one resulted in the dominance of the executive over the judiciary and legislature. These new elites became entrenched during the wars and conflicts that affected the region.

Civic Education in Highly Partisan Times", :abstract "Amid hyperpartisanship, increasing critiques of civic education reform priorities from conservatives, and growing signs of democratic backsliding, can schools provide foundational support for democratic norms, commitments, and capacities? Drawing on a unique national survey of high school principals conducted in 2018, we examine how political context, district priorities, and principal beliefs and characteristics are related to support for civic education. We find that a school’s partisan context is unrelated to most supports for democratic education. Of note, however, support for the discussion of controversial issues is less common in conservative districts, raising important questions about why the discussion of controversial issues (a core building block of democratic societies) is less common in conservative settings. In addition, support for civic education at the school level is highest at schools led by principals who are civically active and in districts that are committed to democratic aims. At a time when school districts face highly contentious politics, these findings indicate that systemic district commitments can help strengthen our civic foundations and that principals and district leaders may be able to promote smalld democracy amid increasingly politicized school governance contexts.

Contemporary forms of backsliding are especially vexing because they are legitimated by the very institutions democracy promoters prioritize but, overall, backsliding today reflects democracy’s advance and not its retreat.

In recent years, however, both the tangible role of the EU in fostering peace beyond its borders and the Union’s famous image as a ‘normative power’ have met substantial challenges. The challenges, which fundamentally alter the context in which the EU supports peace and security, include EU-internal factors, such as democratic backsliding in some member states, electoral success of populist far right parties, or disagreements over migration. They also include external factors, notably the unravelling transatlantic relationship under President Trump or the rise of China in the peace and security domain. This article introduces the special issue ‘Weathering the Storm? The EU as a Global Peace and Security Actor in Turbulent Times’. It first discusses the numerous tests the EU faces in fostering peace beyond its borders, and how past research has evaluated and interpreted the effect of these challenges on EU foreign policy. It then outlines two interrelated shortcomings of past research: an ‘EU navel-gazing’ and focus on how EU policies come into being in Brussels, rather than studying how these policies are implemented ‘on the ground’ – coupled with a lack of interdisciplinary conceptual and empirical debate between peace and conflict research and European Studies. Finally, it discusses how the articles that make up this special issue help to address these shortcomings and how they contribute to the current trend in blurring the lines between domestic and international politics.", :year 2021, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "European Review of International Studies"}, :authors [{:authorId "74443803", :name "Andreas Grimmel"} {:authorId "70784385", :name "J.

Because foreign policy often has geographically specific domestic consequences, we expect opinions to vary with the locality of its impact. In this article, we examine whether individual support for US foreign policy to promote democracy abroad depends on exactly where the policy’s domestic impact will occur. We expect individuals to favor policies that bestow local benefits while opposing those that impose local costs. Accordingly, we argue that support for proposed democracy aid grants will be higher when such aid benefits local firms and organizations. Conversely, we expect that opposition to proposed economic sanctions in the form of development aid cuts will be higher when the associated domestic costs stemming from lost jobs fall locally. Using the results from an original survey experiment, we find evidence that a positive local impact of aid increases support for and reduces opposition to democracy promotion, while a negative local impact of sanctions reduces indifference and increases opposition to punitive policy in the case of democratic backsliding.", :year 2019, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes ["Review"], :journal {:name "International Interactions", :pages "595 - 616", :volume "45"}, :authors [{:authorId "97739137", :name "William Christiansen"} {:authorId "1830489", :name "Tobias Heinrich"} {:authorId "144921918", :name "T.

The global financial crisis has exposed the vulnerability of the Eurozone governance structure to exogenous shocks, and highlighted the problem posed by deep economic discrepancies between member states. The crisis has brought into focus the profound and often adverse consequences that current forms of economic and financial integration have for the adequate functioning of both domestic and supranational institutions. Responding to these difficulties, some significant changes have been made to the Eurozone’s mechanisms – initially in the form of conditional lending to indebted Eurozone member states, and subsequently through the establishment of the European Stability Mechanism, the incorporation of evermore stringent rules regarding national debt levels and deficits, and the implementation of debt-brakes through the Fiscal Compact.

Möglicherweise fand diese sogar, wie Mitchell Orenstein und Daniel Kelemen (2016) diagnostizieren, ein frühes Ende. Denn die Eingriffe in die demokratischen und rechtsstaatlichen Strukturen des Staates haben sich als nachhaltig erwiesen und die Europäische Union (EU) hat bislang wenig entgegensetzen können. Dabei sind die in Polen feststellbaren Entdemokratisierungstendenzen kein Einzelfall. Sie hatten bereits in Ungarn einen Vorläufer, wo ebenfalls seit 2010 umfangreiche politische und rechtliche „Umbaumaßnahmen“ stattgefunden hatten und die Diagnose eines „Democratic Backsliding“ nahelegten – also einer demokratischen Entkonsolidierung. Inzwischen hat sich der Begriff des „Democratic Backsliding“ für Entdemokratisierungstendenzen weltweit etabliert.

While contestation over women’s rights is a far from new phenomenon, over the past two decades opposition to gender equality has become better organized at the transnational level, mobilizing a dispersed set of state and non-state actors, and is becoming more successful in halting the progress of women’s rights. I argue that the position of oppositional actors vis-a-vis women rights activism appears to be strengthened by two recent political developments: democratic backsliding and the closure of civic space. Some preliminary findings show how these interrelated developments lead to an erosion of women’s rights at the national level. Governments use low key tactics to dismantle institutional and implementation arrangements and sideline women’s organisations. Next, I explore the implications of these developments for gender equality norms at the national and international level. The active strategy of counter norming adopted by conservative and religious state and non-state actors, designed to circumvent and also undermine Western norms, is increasingly successful.

The apparently successful transition process, adopting the constitutional democracy and the rule of law in CEE countries is now facing serious challenges. Despite the illusive ideological solidarity, common values and increasing harmonization of law within the European Community, a contrast between the image and the reality has become visible. It turned out that apparently democratically mature new members of the European Community are, in reality, functioning in the shadows of informal networks, political systems and local correlations — while rule-of-law institutions are often too weak or underdeveloped and continuously fail to limit the abuse of uncontrolled state power. Interestingly, early signs of such shallow Europeanisation of the CEE political and legal systems has been for long marginalized by European Community. The cause of the current state is of deeply structural character, and constitutes mostly a proof of failure of defectively carried out process of transformation. The aim of the article is to present some comparative perspective on the subject and discuss the potential reasons of backsliding of CEE legal and political systems.Aktualne uwagi na temat demokracji i rządów prawa w krajach Europy Środkowo-WschodniejW ostatnim czasie większość krajów Europy Środkowej i Wschodniej przechodzi bardzo poważny kryzys rządów prawa i demokracji konstytucyjnej, szczególnie w porównaniu z tzw. okresem akcesyjnym UE. Udany proces transformacji, przyjęcie demokracji konstytucyjnej i rządów prawa w krajach Europy Środkowo-Wschodniej stoi obecnie przed poważnymi wyzwaniami.

Okazało się, że pozornie dojrzali demokratycznie nowi członkowie Wspólnoty Europejskiej funkcjonują w rzeczywistości w cieniu nieformalnej sieci powiązań, podczas gdy instytucje rządów prawa są często zbyt słabe lub słabo rozwinięte i ciągle nie udaje im się ograniczyć nadużycia niekontrolowanej władzy państwowej. Co ciekawe, wczesne oznaki tak płytkiej europeizacji systemów politycznych i prawnych w Europie Środkowo-Wschodniej były długo marginalizowane przez Wspólnotę Europejską.

International press coverage of the region is dominated by problems such as social discontent, crime and drug trafficking, and political corruption. With the rise of Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez, analysts warn of the dawn of a new age of populism and confrontation. All of these things are real or potential problems, to varying degrees. Yet it is important to keep in mind the immense progress that has been made over the past 35 years since the Freedom House survey Freedom, in the World began monitoring the region. A look at the numbers reminds us that Latin America has advanced impressively since the previous dark days of military dictatorships and corrupt autocracies. However, although the region's citizens and governments have largely defeated authoritarian governments, they must now confront the challenges posed by the ineffective state. There are two primary classifications used in the Freedom in the World survey. The first and broadest categorizes every country in the world as \"Free,\" \"Partly Free,\" or \"Not Free.\" A second, more granular assessment involves assigning each nation two numerical scores. The first is for political rights, which include elections, political pluralism, and government functioning. The second evaluates civil liberties, which include freedom of expression, freedom of association, rule of law, and personal autonomy, including minority and women's rights. Each is scored on a 1 to 7 scale in which 1 is the best possible mark and 7 is the worst. The 18 core Latin American countries considered here include Brazil and all of the Spanish-speaking countries except for Cuba. Looking back at this group in 1972, the picture was bleak. Low country scores reflected the primacy of military dictatorships and authoritarian civilian regimes blotting the regional landscape. Just 7 states were Free, with 10 Partly Free and 1 (Panama) labeled Not Free. Even with relative refuges of liberty such as Costa Rica (1.1) and Venezuela (2.2), the average score was a mere 4.1 for political rights and 3.3 for civil liberties. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] By 1977 the picture was even worse, with the advent of General Augusto Pinochet's reign in Chile and the hardening of regimes in places such as Uruguay and Argentina leading to further declines. Free countries (Colombia, Costa Rica, and Venezuela) were actually outnumbered by Not Free countries (Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, and Paraguay). As indicated in Chart 2, the spike in average scores also reflected the deterioration. That year marked the nadir of freedom in Latin America. Starting at the very end of the 1970s and continuing into the next decade, political parties and civil society groups in many countries combined forces to demand an immediate end to the pervasive human rights abuses and economic mismanagement that characterized military rule. By 1982, after several democratic transitions had occurred or were underway, seven countries were listed as Free and just one as Not Free. Moreover the average score increase between 1977 and 1982 was considerable. The trend accelerated during the first half of the 1980s so that in 1987, fully 11 countries were classified as Free. For the first time, the region's average score on political rights improved to below 3. Between 1987 and 1992 progress was mixed. Some countries improved, most dramatically Chile after the fall of Pinochet, but also E1 Salvador after that country's brutal internal conflict finally reached a negotiated conclusion. However, a degree of backsliding occurred in several states that previously had demonstrated progress. Notably, these countries--Colombia, Peru, and Venezuela--are all located in the Andes, which has been Latin America's most volatile subregion (see Chart 3). Peru lapsed all the way from Free to Not Free status following Alberto Fujimori's self-coup of April 1992. In Colombia, increasing violence and instability related to both drug trafficking and the conflict with Marxist FARC and National Liberation Army insurgents resulted in a regression to Partly Free status. …", :year 2008, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes ["Review"], :journal {:name "Harvard international review", :pages "64", :volume "30"}, :authors [{:authorId "113458593", :name "Jake Dizard"}]} {:paperId "e7ebbc30ecd7fcd081778ddfb9d277591bb25e13", :title "Who’s to blame for democratic backsliding: populists, presidents or dominant executives?", :abstract "ABSTRACT When backsliding occurs at the hands of populist presidents who were elected in landslide elections, producing dominant executives with few institutional checks and weak opposition parties, should we blame the decline in democracy on their populist ideology, their presidential powers, or their parties’ dominance in the legislature?

In this way, they contributed to the stability and expansion of the liberal international order in the post-Cold War period.

A Comparative Perspective on Indonesia’s State Enforcement of Religion", :abstract "Recent appraisals of Indonesia’s political regime identify a deterioration of democratic quality, captured by a plethora of concepts such as democratic backsliding, democratic decline, and democratic regression. This deterioration compels scholars to conclude that Indonesia, in its current state, is an illiberal democracy, effectively displacing earlier optimism that Indonesian democracy will eventually be consolidated. This article engages the emerging literature on democratic decline and the rise of illiberal democracy in Indonesia by identifying a key source of its illiberal features. It makes the case linking Indonesia’s illiberal democracy with the involvement of the state in enforcing religion, as seen in the number of existing religious legislations. State enforcement of religion necessarily entails the curtailment of religious freedom, specifically freedom from religion, as the religiosity of Indonesian citizens is forced to shift from voluntary to compulsory. A liberal democracy, by definition,  should not curtail individual liberty in general nor religious freedom in particular. This article then takes a comparative persepctive on Indonesia by comparing the number of religious legislations in Indonesia with those of other democratic states, globally utilizing data from Religion and State (RAS) 3 and V-Dem dataset. The examination yields the observation that Indonesia has a far higher number of religious legislations than the average democracy globally. It indicates a significant level of involvement of the Indonesian state in enforcing religion. In that respect, Indonesia is unusually illiberal for a democracy. The article also emphasizes how religious legislations are mostly found in certain regions, and provides ethnographic evidence of how fasting as a religious norm is enforced during the month of Ramadan in South Kalimantan. This article concludes by reflecting on the uneven democratic quality at the subnational level. Decentralization and the uneven distribution of rights to subnational governments underlie the concentration of religious bylaws in only specific regions of the archipelago.", :year 2022, :openAccessPdf {:url "https://journal.uiii.ac.id/index.php/mpr/article/download/60/100", :status "HYBRID"}, :publicationTypes ["JournalArticle"], :journal {:name "Muslim Politics Review"}, :authors [{:authorId "104928642", :name "G.

In it, Juan Linz created an original framework for understanding democracy under duress. Democratic breakdown was the product of crisis, which did not necessarily lead to authoritarianism but might also resolve through the reequilibration of democracy. The enduring value of that essay is attested to by its continued publication as a separate slim volume and its place on graduate syllabi to this day (Linz 1978). Today, the deep divisions in American politics revealed by President Trump’s impeachment and subsequent trial are paralleled in the U.S. public as well. For example, a recent Pew study on the attitudes of Americans towards the press showed that the left and right have largely separate sources of trusted news. It also showed that the left trusts a much wider array of sources, whereas on the right only Fox News has the trust of more than 50% of those polled (Jurkowitz et al. 2020). We are clearly in the midst of a crisis that will determine the future character of our politics. The issue in the United States is executive power, specifically President Trump’s expansive sense of what he is entitled to do under the constitution. The issue raised by the first article of impeachment is his use of the executive branch and its resources to encourage foreign governments to intervene in the U.S. electoral process on his behalf by attacking the perceived frontrunner in the democratic primaries, former vice president Joe Biden. The second article is concerned with obstruction of Congress, specifically the blanket refusal of the administration to cooperate in congressional efforts to exercise legislative oversight over the executive branch, thereby threatening to destroy the separation of powers. One wonders what James Madison, or even Alexander Hamilton, would have done when confronted with a president of the United States whose reading of the parameters of executive power under the United States Constitution is, as Trump has repeatedly put it, “I have an Article 2, where I have the right to do whatever I want as president.” Under Linz’s framework, when democracy is threatened by crisis, as it is now, it can fail as it did classically in multiple cases in interwar Europe and in bureaucratic authoritarian Latin America. Alternatively, with proactive intervention by democratic actors, democracy can be defended, and the system can be restored to equilibrium. The interwar cases of reequilibration—Czechoslovakia, Finland, and Belgium—largely returned to the status quo ante (Capoccia 2005). The great postwar case of reequilibration—the crisis of the French Fourth Republic in 1958 —included a major reconfiguration of the institutions of democracy with the birth of the Fifth (Suleiman 1994). Today’s situation in the United States and elsewhere is less dichotomous in terms of outcomes. Linz’s conceptualization of democratic breakdown is punctuated. It involves critical events that mark a decisive abrogation of the minimal conditions for democracy, like coups, civil wars, putsches, and seizures of power. Today democracy seems to fail less in this wholesale punctuated fashion. Rather it deteriorates, slowly in what contemporary comparative politics has called backsliding (Bermeo 2016; Waldner and Lust 2018). This sometimes leads to authoritarian regime change, but in other cases, just to a deterioration of the quality of democracy. Are there potential breakdown scenarios for American democracy? Only the possibility of a slow death really exists. Nothing is possible except under the cover of rule of law, making grand gestures unlikely. Nevertheless, Trump’s presidency represents a substantial weakening of the horizontal accountability of the legislative branch over the executive. Furthermore, the failure of the Roberts Court to expedite cases concerning the refusal of executive officials to testify in impeachment hearings or of executive agencies to hand over documents (Damante and Gorod 2019), makes the likelihood that the Supreme Court will remedy this situation or act to exercise substantial accountability over the executive seem slim. Indeed, the Trump administration’s ability to effectively pack the lower courts means that many of the issues related to executive oversight may never reach the Supreme Court in the first instance.

Covid-19 has posed for Sri Lanka not only a public health challenge and an economic challenge but also, perhaps most seriously, a crisis of constitutional democracy. Although questions have been raised about the accuracy of government statistics, the scale of testing and contact tracing, and failures in providing protective equipment to front-line workers including military personnel, there is broad public approval of the government’s crisis response. However, much more alarming are the clear signs in the government’s response that the public health emergency has provided the impetus for an aggressive executive takeover of the state, steepening the curve of de-democratization. The chapter then describes the aspects of the governmental crisis response that are the cause of worry, and offers an analysis based on a framework drawn from comparative politics and comparative constitutional law as to the agentic, institutional, and causal dimensions of the democratic backslide underway in Sri Lanka. While the pandemic has undoubtedly boosted the process of executive aggrandizement that had already commenced, this catalysis may in fact also shorten the authoritarian cycle, because the accelerated de-democratization is likely to result in executive actions that cross the threshold of public tolerance sooner in what as yet remains a procedural democracy. © the several contributors 2021.", :year 2021, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "", :pages "349-362", :volume ""}, :authors [{:authorId "82818522", :name "Bhavani Fonseka"} {:authorId "123514593", :name "Luwie Ganeshathasan"} {:authorId "84621214", :name "A.

Cook’s argumentation is somewhat contradictory in the book’s closing pages. He criticizes the Obama Administration for the failure of its actions to match rhetoric in Egypt and lack of sufficiently vocal messaging on democratic backsliding in Turkey, yet acknowledges that alternative actions would not have altered outcomes. He also argues that the United States can play a role in upholding democratic values and investing in technical assistance programs, yet notes the limited effect beyond avoiding the worst possible outcome of instilling mistrust on all sides.

The main argument is that the limitation of freedom of assembly provided the state-owned broadcaster with a new means of delegitimizing the current enemies. The dominant strategy, outcasting, assumed the categorizing of political opponents as madmen and criminals. By showing the protesters as notorious and multiple offenders, the state television diminished their credibility and deprived them of legitimacy in their political roles in order to stabilize antidemocratic tendencies and reduce the threat of political system breakdown that came from ordinary Poles whose non-compliance took the form of protests and oppositional actors responsible for organizing resistance. The media also addressed the risk stemming from intra-elite splits. The opposition to the democratic backsliding, erosion of the rule of law, and political rights violations, which deviated from the ruling party’s course, was on a par with a revolt over the government.

Initially, this was characterised by optimism, with scholars praising the EU for exporting institutional democracy through its mechanism of conditionality. This research, however, has given little attention to the micro-level foundations of the process. Yet the recent increase in Euroscepticism and anti-democratic, extremist tendencies have pointed to the importance of individual attitudes, even leading academics to argue that a democratic backsliding is taking place in Central and Eastern Europe. This thesis intends to re-examine the case of the EU’s transformative power, focusing specifically on its micro-level impact on the political attitudes of citizens and elites. The research question thus asks: to what extent does the EU have a transformative power on political attitudes? The thesis consists of three research papers that use quantitative and qualitative methods to examine EU influence on two types of actors, the general population and bureaucratic elites, focusing on two types of attitudes: support for democracy and support for the EU. The overall findings show that the Union does have a micro-level impact on attitudes both at the elite and citizen levels, though this is contingent on the nature of the relationship with the EU, as well as individuals’ support for the Union. \nIn the first paper, the thesis demonstrates that the EU can affect attitudes towards democracy among the post-communist population, although this is contingent on the state’s association with the Union: when this is simply economic or political, the effect is positive; however, when the association involves integration as a candidate or member state, a rise in Euroscepticism among the population can in fact lead to lower levels of democratic support. This finding shows that Euroscepticism has an important role in altering the EU’s transformative influence on individuals in states integrated within the EU. \nIndeed, the consequences of this could be highly significant, especially when it comes to political and bureaucratic elites whose daily job affects the politics and policy of their countries. As a result, the second paper examines the EU’s effect on the attitudes of civil servants working in the national bureaucracies of the new member states. Using international socialisation theory, the paper shows that civil servants generally tend to support the EU, and this is higher among officials whose daily work brings them into contact with it. In addition, the analysis further explores the scope conditions that facilitate socialisation, revealing that both the quantity and quality of contact with EU-related issues – in terms of prolonged exposure as well as interpersonal contact – matter in explaining the sources of variation in levels of support. \nLastly, to examine more closely how bureaucrats see the EU, the third paper uses a more in-depth qualitative study to explore the perceptions of Brussels-based diplomats on the economic, political and security dimensions of the Union. Through a comparative analysis, the paper once again shows that the state-level relationship with the EU can affect the perspectives formed by elites. Using original interview data, the research develops a typology of four types of “perspectives of the EU”, based on two dimensions: expectations from the EU and evaluation of the EU. The paper’s main argument is that the state-level relationship between the Union and the home country can greatly affect how elites representing those states perceive the Union. \nThe main contributions of the thesis relate to a deeper understanding of the EU’s individual-level transformative power, through a discussion of its objects (citizens and elites), its mechanisms (direct and indirect), its scope (internal and external) and its outcomes (attitudes towards democracy and the EU). First, it demonstrates that the EU has a real and measurable effect in changing the perceptions of both citizens and elites in post-communist states. Second, it highlights that its impact works both through indirect mechanisms of a state-level political association, as well as direct mechanisms of international socialisation. In addition, it also reveals that Euroscepticism can act as a moderator, turning the EU’s positive democratising effect into a negative one, thus bringing together the literature on the transformative power of Europe with research on attitudes towards the EU and Euroscepticism. Third, it demonstrates that the EU has a transformative power both internally and externally, including non-accession third states. Lastly, it shows that the EU’s transformative power can influence attitudes towards democracy and the EU. Ultimately, the overall findings show that the Union has an impact on the attitudes of both elites and citizens, though this is contingent on the nature of the relationship with the EU, as well as individuals’ support for the Union.", :year 2018, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "", :volume ""}, :authors [{:authorId "1402409653", :name "Fanni Tóth"}]} {:paperId "ec44bdb020fbc8bf8a4eb5c2c4f6b66ee6773c7d", :title "Democratic backsliding, religious institutions and the constitution of citizenship in sub-Saharan Africa", :abstract nil, :year 2017, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "", :pages "63-79", :volume ""}, :authors [{:authorId "50271650", :name "E.

Therefore, contrary to many hopes, after the 2010 presidential election Ukraine is backsliding into \"soft\" authoritarianism. However, the failures of the regime to deliver socioeconomic promises have united the electorate in different regions of the country in their growing criticism of the authorities. Keywords: authoritarianism, Orange Revolution, Ukrainian-Russian relations, Viktor Yanukovych ********** For political scientists, Ukraine is an extremely interesting case study. The country balances between the West and Russia--while maintaining an official aim to join the European Union--its political culture has both pro-European and post-Soviet components, and it appears to be the CIS state that is closest to Europe politically. Ukraine stands in contrast to many other former Soviet republics in that it gained its independence peacefully and without interethnic conflicts. Despite the turmoil, since 1991 political developments in Ukraine have evolved so that until recently the country's most important decisions were reached by compromise. Ukraine became the first country of the CIS in which democratic elections, held in 1994, altered both the composition of the parliament and the presidency. Ukraine's 1996 Constitution was the result of a compromise between the president and the parliament, as opposed to Boris Yeltsin's \"revolutionary\" approach, which involved an armed assault on the Russian parliament in 1993. Ukraine has been poised to build democracy, a free market, state institutions, and a modernized nation simultaneously (which has been referred to as the \"quadruple transition\" (1)). None of this can be achieved overnight, and it has demanded compromises with the country's post-Communist nomenclature. The drawback to Ukraine's system of power-sharing and political compromise was that it preserved the influence of the Communist past, which, in comparison with Poland, Hungary, and the Baltic countries, was not radically restricted. These dilemmas and contradictions were reflected in the 2004 nonviolent Orange Revolution, which brought into power the pro-Western president Viktor Yushchenko. But Orange governments (2005-2010) ultimately proved to be ineffective. This created background for a backlash: the 2010 election of President Viktor Yanukovych (who did not manage to win despite of falsifying elections in 2004). He quickly reneged upon the constitutional reform of 2004 (which restricted the power of the presidency) and returned to the constitutional model of President Leonid Kuchma. Therefore, it can be concluded that the Orange Revolution has not led to creation of its intended democratic checks and balances. The question arises: was the Orange Revolution an aberration, and would the country revert to a Russian authoritarian model? This article begins with the analysis of why the previously discredited Yanukovych was elected president and how despite democratic rhetoric and arguments for stability (which at the beginning soothed Western leaders and analysts), he started to build Russian model of \"stability\" which he openly praised during his first official visit to Russia in early March 2010. (2) Then, I will analyze the limitations faced by Yanukovych in building an effective authoritarian regime. Setting the Stage: The Orange Legacy and the Reemergence of Viktor Yanukovych Ukraine was deliberately polarized in the 2004 presidential election campaign. (3) Throughout the 2004 election phase, the Kuchma administration did everything possible to prevent Viktor Yushchenko, former prime minister and leader of the center-right Our Ukraine bloc, from winning the elections. Its main strategy was to present Yushchenko as a radical nationalist who would \"oppress\" the Russian-speaking population, whereas Viktor Yanukovych, prime minister and representative of the Donetsk clan, was portrayed as a friend to Russia. …", :year 2011, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "Demokratizatsiya", :pages "93", :volume "19"}, :authors [{:authorId "116843657", :name "O.

While the primary effect of online repression is to silence criticism and forestall collective action, a secondary effect is to induce self-censorship among the masses. Yet scant research examines how self-censorship works, nor discusses its implications for entrenching authoritarianism and encouraging democratic backsliding. This article proposes a simple expected utility model of self-censorship, arguing that citizens will more likely self-censor when the expected costs of online political expression outweigh its benefits. Analysing the fourth wave of the Asian Barometer survey of 10,216 respondents across eight Southeast Asian countries, I find that higher income politically engaged social media users are indeed less likely to express their political opinions.

She employs a rich variety of methods for the task. Specifically, part II explores the theory’s implications for charismatic demand, or the attitudes and behavior of followers. Chapter 3 examines public opinion data from Venezuela to show the dominance of charismatic linkages over programmatic or organizational linkages among Chavez supporters at the time he was alive. Chapter 4 uses focus groups to identify evidence of charismatic attachment among contemporary Chavistas and Peronists. Chapter 5 presents the results of a face-to-face survey experiment in both countries, finding that referencing the charismatic qualities of a fictitious candidate increases charismatic support for the movement (albeit results are not as strong in Venezuela as in Argentina, due to ceiling effects). This combination of evidence is one of the most persuasive parts of the book. Part III explores the implications of the theory for the supply of charismatic leaders. Chapter 6 uses mostly historical data and interviews with surviving party leaders and activists to trace out the reasons for the success or failure of successors. Chapter 7 shifts to highlight the negative consequences of charisma for state-building and democratic consolidation, which it attempts to demonstrate with a historical analysis of the Peronist experience. Andrews-Lee concludes (ch. 8) by restating the book’s argument and findings and reviewing four shadow cases that affirm the persistence thesis: Alberto Fujimori in Peru, Silvio Berlusconi in Italy, Thaksin Shinawatra in Thailand, and Mao Zedong in China. Interestingly, while the shadow cases in the conclusion reinforce the book’s point that charisma is a measurable and enduring form of linkage, the effort at a broader, comparative perspective also highlights two gaps in the author’s theoretical framework. To be clear, these are not fundamental flaws, but scope conditions that deserve further specification. The first is the author’s decision to focus primarily on populist charismatic movements, that is, charismatic movements whose leaders frame their mission in Manichaean terms of a cosmic struggle between a virtuous common people and an evil, conspiring elite. In the introduction, Andrews-Lee deliberately defines populism as a subtype of charismatic linkage. It is correct that some charismatic movements are populist, but her categorization implies that some other charismatic movements are not. Indeed, earlier studies of charisma (pre-2000) frequently included normatively positive cases such as the US civil rights movement under Martin Luther King Jr. or the Indian independence movement under Mahatma Gandhi— movements that avoided demonizing their opponents and strengthened liberal democracy. What of these other, more pluralist types of charismatic leadership? Likewise, while Weber and followers such as Robert Michels were wrong to argue that specific charismatic movements inevitably fade, the bulk of the movements that inspired their work—such as Communism and Social Democracy in Europe—became highly institutionalized parties. This process has continued in the wealthy democracies, where protest movements have given rise to new party families, such as the Green and the Radical Right. Indeed, one gets the feeling that these voters mistrust charismatic leadership and expect revolutionary leaders to build institutions. Rather than arguing that charismatic movements always become routinized or that they always persist, the broader evidence suggests that we should be asking why charismatic linkage is dominant in some countries but not others, a question that motivated the work of political sociologists such as Edward Shils. A more comparative study could answer this question. Ultimately, though, the strength of this volume is precisely its ability to move forward a more productive, empirically based discussion of charisma that helps us identify these questions. The leader-centric definition and the author’s causal arguments are worked out in impressive detail, in a way that invites further analysis and testing. Andrews-Lee has made a remarkable contribution to the study of charisma and political representation that sets a high standard for future research.", :year 2022, :openAccessPdf {:url "https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/DBB1C2E25242C78798F4C2C90E79898D/S1537592722003164a.pdf/div-class-title-span-class-italic-democratic-backsliding-and-public-administration-how-populists-in-government-transform-state-bureaucracies-span-edited-by-michael-w-bauer-b-guy-peters-jon-pierre-kutsal-yesilkagit-and-stefan-becker-new-york-cambridge-university-press-2021-320p-99-99-cloth-div.pdf", :status "BRONZE"}, :publicationTypes ["Review"], :journal {:name "Perspectives on Politics", :pages "1504 - 1506", :volume "20"}, :authors [{:authorId "2089469164", :name "M.

However, a clear trend has been definitively established in the recent academic discourse pointing to a marked decline in the quality of democracies in several democratizing states. While the root causes for this decline continue to be a contentious subject, much of the existing literature depends on institutional theory to explain the cause of democratic backsliding. Concurrently, we have seen a dramatic stream of news about the state of democracy in two of the world’s most significant democraciesthe US and India. Given the seeming influence of right-wing leaders in these countries, the question then arises about the effect an ethnonationalist executive would have on a multicultural democracy. With this, I seek to establish first: what constitutes an ethnonationalist executive, secondly: whether or not ethnonationalism as a manifest ideology in these cases lead to democratic decline logically, and thirdly: whether former President Trump and current PM Modi, if determined to be ethnonationalist executives, have instituted policy that clearly stems from normative ethnonationalist arguments, with a demonstrable decline in the appropriate democratic metrics. The goal of this project is meant to better understand the competing ideologies that are of apparent importance to democracy and its maintenance and aims to be of assistance to both policymakers and researchers alike.

Due to its decisive role in national liberation and state-building, the Serbian military has always enjoyed high societal reputation. Since the 19th century, the military also played an important role of a nation-builder and social elevator for the lower strata of society. However, Serbia also has a very long tradition of military involvement in politics with several coups that decisively shaped the course of national history. Since the outset of Serbia’s state-building in the first half of the 19th century, Serbia experienced four successful military coups and many occasions when its armed forces were used to quash domestic unrest. The reasons behind the robust involvement of armed forces in Serbian (and Yugoslav politics) have been diverse and ranged from an ambition to provide internal stability and defend national or corporate interests to a desire to change the country’s foreign policy orientation. Since the end of the Cold War, the military played an ambiguous role on some occasions undermining democracy, while on others being an agent of democratic transformation. Since 2006, the military of Serbia has been placed under civilian democratic control and seems to have internalized its role of a politically neutral and professional force with a mission to defend the country, support civilian authorities in the event of emergency, and contribute to international peace and security. Still, the ongoing democratic backsliding, the lack of clarity about the state’s strategic outlook, and the still unresolved status of Serbia’s former province Kosovo all preserve the potential for civil-military tensions in the future.", :year 2020, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "", :volume ""}, :authors [{:authorId "101443134", :name "Filip Ejdus"}]} {:paperId "ee953807228a3b036f352d2dffd59c05c8ad3aa1", :title "Latin America and Comparative Politics", :abstract "I n this issue, we have a special section on “Las Américas” devoted to several pieces in comparative politics from and about Latin America. In the pugilistic arts, a competitor who hits harder than expected is described as “punching above weight.” In comparative politics, this captures the position of the study of politics in Latin America. Even though only four percent of articles in leading political science journals mention the region in their titles or abstracts (Wilson and Knutsen 2022), it has played a critical role in the development of contemporary theory in comparative politics. In contrast, among the seventeen political scientists interviewed in Passion, Craft and Method in Comparative Politics (Munck and Snyder 2007), there are three Latin Americanists, more than any other region (Guillermo O’Donnell, Alfred Stepan, and David Collier), as well as a scholar who did some of his best work in Latin America (Philippe Schmitter). In this issue we highlight a series of articles and a reflection which consider some of the pressing problems of our age— democratic backsliding, resistance and repression, policing, suffrage, colonialism and its legacies, inclusion, and empowerment—all set in Latin America. First, however, it is worth considering how work on this region has developed by reflecting on the contributions of the scholars working on Latin America highlighted in Passion, Craft, and Method. Guillermo O’Donnell (1936–2011) was an Argentinian who received his academic training in theUnited States and split his time in the profession between Latin America and the United States. He spent the lion’s share of his career as a faculty member at Notre Dame, which remains a major center of research on Latin America. His early work was dedicated to patterns of development in Latin America, where his theory of bureaucratic authoritarianism linked the end of the “easy” phase of importsubstitution industrialization with the creation of a political coalition of technocrats and military officers who imposed austerity on the newly empowered middle sector (working and middle classes) in the quest for new sources of growth. It was a highly influential work in explaining the second global wave of authoritarianism in the developing world in the 1960s and 1970s (O’Donnell 1973). Along with Barrington Moore (1966), O’Donnell produced one of the definitive works that undermined the teleological link between economic development and democratization associated with some varieties of modernization theory. O’Donnell also presided over a multi-volume collection which brought together a large group of leading comparativists to make sense of the onset of the third wave of democratization in Southern Europe and Latin America in the 1970s and 1980s (O’Donnell, Schmitter, and Whitehead 1986). His contribution with Schmitter to that project was a novel actor-centered process model of democratic transition that dominated discussions of democratization in the third wave (O’Donnell and Schmitter 1986). Following the almost universal installation of democratic regimes in the region, O’Donnell turned to the problems of democratic consolidation, deepening, and the institutionalization of fledgling democratic regimes. Under the rubric of “delegative democracy,” he warned of the autonomy of executive power, the weakness of horizontal accountability, and the precariousness of democracy in Latin America (O’Donnell 1994, 1998, and 2004). This analysis in many ways presaged our current attempts to make sense of the widespread phenomenon of democratic backsliding. While this summary certainly does not do full justice to O’Donnell’s work as a whole or the magnitude of his contributions, it does highlight how his concerns about the form of rule in his native Argentina provided him with a unique perspective that enabled him to make general contributions to theories of comparative politics. His partner in the influential actor-centered process model of democratization, himself the author of a plethora of other important works on regimes and regime change, was Philippe Schmitter. Schmitter was born in the United States but has lived inmany parts of the globe, and as result is a citizen of the world, despite his long associations with both Stanford and the European University Institute. His earliest work also made fundamental contributions that continue to shape our contemporary understanding of systems of interest articulation both in democracies and autocracies.

To develop this argument, this Article advances three main points. First, while the backsliding literature has thus far tended to focus on the sociological and institutional factors shaping the collapse of democratic regimes, this Article begins from the inverse premise: the sociological and institutional factors that affirmatively facilitate democratic equality, inclusion, and political action (Part I). This exploration of the affirmative drivers of democracy helps cast into sharper relief the more systemic and chronic ways in which current political and institutional dynamics make genuine democratic equality and participation impossible for many constituencies. In particular, democracy is undermined not only by more chronic crises of unequal power but also by systemic exclusion (Part II).

This development accelerated in the 1990s in tandem with the transition and democratization processes that started after the fall of the Soviet Union. However, in many places democratization has stopped or started to reverse, leading to backsliding away from democracy.

To explore this question, I propose a cultural theory of democratic deconsolidation, and test it with the Asian Barometer Korean surveys conducted over the period 2011-15. The analysis of these surveys indicates that socioeconomic development under the sponsorship of the state and big businesses has failed to \"emancipate\" both ordinary citizens and political leaders from the Confucian legacies of political paternalism and social harmony. Moreover, it has failed to instill them with \"the bourgeois impulse\" to become a free and equal being. As the habits of their hearts and minds, these legacies powerfully motivate both groups to reembrace or condone the resurgence of autocratic political practices.

In this respect their positions sometimes aligned with those of autocracies. Conversely, states that had recently emerged from the shadow of autocratic rule, for whom the sovereignty costs associated with the Court were countervailed by the benefit of insurance against backsliding toward autocracy, generally favored a stronger Court.

Due to voters’ reference-dependent preferences, opportunistic authoritarians emerge: against their own liberal tendencies, these leaders choose to challenge norms of democracy (and then partially back down) in order to lower the standards to which voters will hold them. In equilibrium, voters do sanction serious, sudden blows to democratic norms, but electoral incentives do not inoculate against gradual backsliding—in fact, under certain conditions they encourage it.

However, this is not necessarily the case. The goals of the actors who produce court-packing help to explain why the co-optation of the judiciary can have a substantial negative effect on liberal democracy in some (although not all) cases. In this respect, we distinguish two types of court-packing. First, policy-driven court-packing occurs when politicians manipulate the composition of courts in order to assure a quick implementation of policies. Although this tends to negatively affect judicial independence, it is not per se a first step towards regime change. Second, regime-driven court-packing happens when politicians alter the composition of the courts with the goal of eroding democracy. In this case, court-packing’s negative effect on judicial independence has a systemic negative effect on different dimensions of liberal democracy. Relying on a wide range of primary and secondary sources, we conceptualize these two types of court-packing by comparing two cases: Carlos Menem (1989–99) in Argentina, seeking judicial support to carry out pro-market economic reforms, and Hugo Chávez (1999–2013) and Nicolás Maduro (2013–present) in Venezuela, seeking to control the judiciary in the context of democratic backsliding.", :year 2023, :openAccessPdf {:url "https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/8E3F2FE612BED68683A49AB9BF67FE27/S2045381723000011a.pdf/div-class-title-court-packing-and-democratic-decay-a-necessary-relationship-div.pdf", :status "HYBRID"}, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "Global Constitutionalism"}, :authors [{:authorId "2202830307", :name "Benjamin Garcia Holgado"} {:authorId "2060567658", :name "Raúl Sánchez Urribarrí"}]} {:paperId "f0bb47d2f7b54b1218e8bed9016283f9374a67da", :title "Civic Education and Democratic Backsliding in the Wake of Kenya’s Post-2007 Election Violence", :abstract "This article examines two unexplored questions concerning the impact of civic education programs in emerging democracies: (1) whether such programs have longer-terms effects and (2) whether civic education can be effective under conditions of democratic “backsliding.” We investigate these questions in the context of a large-scale civic education program in Kenya just before the disputed 2007 election that sparked a wave of ethnic clashes and brought the country to the brink of civil war. Analysis of a survey of 1,800 “treatment” and 1,800 “control” individuals shows that the program had significant long-term effects on variables related to civic competence and engagement, with less consistent effects on democratic values.

For instance, in the Cold War era, locales outside the “advanced industrial” countries were the objects of “area study” in comparative politics, a theoretical approach that treated the politics of each world region as its own form of exceptionalism. Periodically, there have been moments when Americanists and comparativists “discovered” and deeply influenced each other. For instance, after communism collapsed in Eastern Europe, there was a widespread belief that the literature on democratic institutions pioneered by Americanists would serve well in that context. After all, the argument went, the West had solved the problems of economic management and the practice of representative mass democracy, and thus for others it was just a question of picking the right institutions to share in democracy and prosperity. The largest global recession in 70 years, mass migration of populations in response to an escalating cascade of ecological disruptions, and one pandemic later, the intellectual consensus underlying this belief is more than a bit tarnished. Instead, we now ignore at our own peril more circumspect views like those expressed by Dani Rodrik (2011), that not all “good” things are possible at the same time— perhaps high levels of globalization, national sovereignty and democracy are not compatible. Certainly, the present global wave of democratic backsliding is grist for this mill. With these developments the tables have turned, and the work of comparativists who have long studied the failure of democratic regimes has become newly relevant for Americanists (Kaufman and Haggard 2019; Kuo 2019; Lieberman et al. 2019; Weyland 2020). Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt (2018) revisited, adapted, and expanded on the ideas of Juan Linz (1978) concerning the dangers to democracy in the age of Trump, and political science as a cautionary tale best seller was born. Another moment of convergence between the subfields came at the onset of the study of modern democracy in behavioral and functionalist terms. American political scientists thought of the United States as just one of a handful of democracies and sought explanations for the survival of the lucky few. Among the first to offer a hypothesis was Gabriel Almond (1956), who strongly differentiated between Anglo-American and Continental European democratic systems. Why this partition? Because for Almond the former had homogeneous political cultures, whereas those of the latter were fragmented. In later versions of this argument this difference was put in institutional rather than cultural terms, as the distinction between two-party and multiparty democracies (Almond and Powell 1966). Unified political cultures permitted two-party competition and alternation with cross-cutting cleavages, whereas more fragmented political cultures led to fractured party systems. The examples used to illustrate these different systems were highly value laden, with Anglo-American two-party democracy being seen as high quality and stable, in contrast to the multiparty democracies of theWeimar Republic, postwar Italy, and the fourth French Republic that were seen as flawed and unstable. This understanding of the superiority of two-party systems was shared by Downs (1957) and to some extent by Duverger (1959) as well. Early dissenters to this consensus, not surprisingly, were European scholars engaged with American political science, including Giovanni Sartori (1966), Dankwart Rustow (1956), and Arend Lijphart (1968). All three noted that there were several European cases—the Scandinavian countries, the Netherlands, and the Federal Republic of Germany—that were multiparty and yet managed to have stable, high-quality democracy. Lijphart made this distinction the centerpiece of his research agenda, coining the concepts of “consociational democracy” and majoritarian versus pluralist varieties of democracy. Focusing initially on the success of democracy in his native Netherlands, Lijphart (1969, 1977) argued that, by a pattern of institutional adaption and the forging of power-sharing institutions, theDutch were able to create a stable, high-quality democracy despite a political culture divided between a more traditional Protestant community, a secular socialist one, and other smaller communities. The key to solving this riddle was having power-sharing institutions, notably parliamentary coalition government, proportional representation, and federalism fused with a bicameral legislature. Since then, Lijphart (1989, 2012) has argued that", :year 2021, :openAccessPdf {:url "https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/C48B07F992BF1B274D88F0B49D772441/S1537592721003121a.pdf/div-class-title-race-and-politics-in-america-div.pdf", :status "BRONZE"}, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "Perspectives on Politics", :pages "1053 - 1059", :volume "19"}, :authors [{:authorId "83513110", :name "M.

A whole academic industry, which is studying populism both in the region and beyond, rapidly developed. Political theory is also contributing to the effort to understand populism by conceptualizing the diverse sources and manifestations of the populist phenomenon. As a researcher within the EU-funded project PaCE (Populism and Civic Engagement1), I have studied the causal mechanisms that explain the rise and success of populist parties and movements in Europe.2 Prominent among these is the reaction of voters to the shrinking policy space. This trend of turning liberal democracies into “democracy without choice” (Krastev 2002) has long been noted. In such a regime democratic say of the citizens becomes irrelevant: people may be able to change government but not its policies, as these have been outsourced to non-elected, democratically unaccountable bodies. It is this process of emptying democracy of its democratic content that is referred to as “depoliticization”. Some identify the cartelisation of party systems in developed democracies as the primary source of depoliticization (Katz, Mair 1995). As a result of growing cartelization (but also due to other forms of outsourcing democratic decision-making), the perceptions of political inefficacy – that one can change the government but not its policies – become widespread. This alienates voters from mainstream parties, who offer the same policy menu despite nominal ideological differences in their platforms. A further major source of voter alienation from mainstream parties is the growing perception that elected governments are not sufficiently responsive, as they often respond not to their electorates but to other (external or internal) constraints and pressures – be these from international markets or national businesses, or even from media empires acting as “PR divisions of business groups” (Smilova 2014).

This non-Western icon of liberal democracy recently underwent a series of setbacks due to the restoration of autocratic governance by the President Park Geun-hye government. Why did liberal democracy backslide in the highly globalized and modernized country, contrary to what is expected from modernization and other prominent theories of democratization? To explore this question, we propose a cultural theory of democratic deconsolidation, and test it with the latest wave of the Asian Barometer Survey conducted in Korea in 2015. The analysis indicates that socioeconomic development under the sponsorship of the state and big businesses has failed to “emancipate” both the ruling class and the masses from the Confucian legacies of political paternalism and social harmony. Moreover, it has failed to instill them with “the bourgeois impulse” to become a free and equal being. As the habits of their hearts and minds, these legacies powerfully motivate both groups to reembrace or condone the resurgence of autocratic political practices. Theoretically, therefore, the deconsolidation of liberal democracy in Korea and the prevalence of affinity for paternalistic autocracy among its people can be considered two solid pieces of evidence confirming the thesis of “No bourgeois, no democracy”.

The objective of the author is to introduce the consequences of the lack of meso-level politics for the backslide of the democratic system. The paper focusing on Hungarian counties seeks to explore the three-decade-long process leading to the progressive elimination of these bodies from the public power arena. The Hungarian case demonstrates how the overall administrative and political centralisation process has contributed to the hollowing-out of meso-level political actors. The Hungarian case study underlines the complex interrelations between the macro-political system, and the territorial political governmental arenas from the aspect of the centre and periphery power relations. Many European regional governments are not only platforms for territorial interest representation but also a counterweight to the central level contributing to the quality and stability of democratic governance. The study reviewing the situation of Hungarian counties draws on the author’s previous empirical research experiences and is a part of the ongoing research on governance issues of peripheral areas 1 . The results of the analyses discuss the implications of the hollowing-out of county governments on the electoral and party system, the modification of the institutional channels of interest representation. The Hungarian example appears to corroborate the analogy with the theory of second order elections. The theory of second order elections recognized the impact on the turnout and electoral preferences based on the changing role of different governance levels, by the same token, it seems that the weakening power position of the meso contributes to the decline of political competition and publicity by minimizing the interest of the public in general.

The public value discourse emerged in the 1990s, justifying the need for the concept through a deficit in democratic legitimacy, the delivery paradox, as well as market failure and the critique of New Public Management. Public value focuses on the ultimate purpose of the use of public resources and can thus serve to strengthen outcome legitimacy and downward accountability. Arguably, the most productive interpretation of the public value concept rests along the lines of a normative, conceptual orientation for managerial action, accompanied by a (so far somewhat sparse) set of practical tools and reasoning for public managers. Five tasks of PVM were identified: (1) conducting political management to secure legitimacy for particular value propositions; (2) leveraging public value opportunities through networks and a range of delivery mechanisms; (3) ensuring continuing democratisation through helping the realisation of politically empowered citizenship; (4) ensuring learning across multiple levels and audiences; and (5) cultivating a wider view of sustainable wellbeing for all. Regarding the applicability of PVM across various dimensions of administrative traditions and cultures, it would seem that the tasks are more compatible with some cultures and traditions than others. For instance, these roles seem more compatible with non-politicised public administrations that grant high societal status and discretion to civil servants, and provide them with generalist training and career options. One of the key open questions is under what conditions can a public value approach contribute to changes in the given public administration culture, in particular towards the development of downward accountability mechanisms in the context of democratic backsliding and constraints to bureaucratic autonomy.", :year 2020, :openAccessPdf {:url "https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/nispa-2020-0019", :status "GOLD"}, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "NISPAcee Journal of Public Administration and Policy", :pages "161 - 180", :volume "13"}, :authors [{:authorId "2099496", :name "Michal Sedlačko"}]} {:paperId "f23a2d8b20b049439eb34acdb1911da9b6eeaa0e", :title "Turkey in transition: the dynamics of domestic and foreign politics", :abstract "In the face of an ongoing process of democratic backsliding, recent scholarship on Turkish politics reflects a quest to explain the shifting domestic and foreign policy dynamics following the secon...", :year 2020, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "Democratization", :pages "1042 - 1043", :volume "28"}, :authors [{:authorId "1748882691", :name "Canan Aslan Akman"}]} {:paperId "f2771f5b85ea10b5fbba201026337650cc868c46", :title "Personality, Context, and Support for Autocracy in Latin America", :abstract "At the end of the 20th century, after years of dictatorship reigning, it seemed that democracy had won the political battle (Abramowitz 2018).

In previous episodes of backsliding the major threat to democracy came from military coups, totalitarianism, or communism (Levitsky and Ziblatt 2018). In the current era, the main threat to democracy’s survival is the preferences of some of its citizens who support autocratic forms of government. In fact, since the Cold War ended most democratic breakdowns have occurred by elected governments (Levitsky and Ziblatt 2018). Given that democracies are now increasingly vulnerable from within, it is of utmost importance that we understand why do some individuals prefer autocracy while others support democracy. Latin America is especially vulnerable with respect to this rejection of democracy among the public. According to data from the AmericasBarometer, since 2016 there has been a significant decrease in the average support for democracy in the region. While in 2014 66% affirmed that democracy is the best form of government, in 2018 only 57% said so. Perhaps more alarming is the fact that this rejection of democracy coincides with increasing levels of support for autocracy.

The problem could be model misspecification: incumbent support is not included as a potential path by which negative performance appraisals affect regime attitudes, even though most work to date has substantiated such a link and incumbent support is theorized to affect regime support in the present study. Bolstering the global analysis, two regional analyses—one on Africa, the other on Asia (pp. 115–16)—cannot speak to contextual determinants of regime support but do allow for the exploration of additional mechanisms. Given the book’s research design, it is worth bearing in mind that key findings admit multiple interpretations. The study shows, for example, that more positive perceptions of the quality of democracy enhance support for democratic regimes. The author interprets this relationship causally in the section on policy implications, recommending that democratic leaders focus on deepening democracy (rather than providing generic public goods like economic well-being and public infrastructure) to gain more popular support (p. 170). However, democratic performance evaluations could be endogenous: people who like their political regime may report that it functions better. The direction of the causal arrow, and therefore the effect of any intervention, is not clear-cut. Likewise, the study finds that political liberalization is associated with more critical attitudes toward autocratic regimes, which could mean that controlled political liberalization is likely to hasten autocracy’s demise rather than enhance authoritarian regimes’ legitimacy. Yet it is difficult to be firm in these conclusions given that the tests are all cross-sectional. More critical attitudes toward the regime could in fact be the cause of liberalization. These possibilities make the study a generative starting point for further research and, in that regard, very valuable, but there are limits to what can be confidently inferred from the research design. In the face of democratic backsliding and authoritarian retrenchment, understanding why citizens have—and lose—confidence in regime institutions is more important than ever. Citizen Support provides a useful counterpoint to the field’s recent emphasis on processes of political attitude formation that are unique to autocracies. Its findings will be of interest to scholars of regimes, public opinion, and political trust as well as advocates of better governance and democracy. Combining extensive survey data and a comprehensive model notable for its synthesis of prominent cultural and institutional explanations, Mauk sheds light on the common logic of regime support in democracies and autocracies.

After 1989-1990, they have largely spurned a quarter-century long demographic window of opportunity for reform, by insufficiently adapting their policy models to prepare for fast population aging ahead. Especially in Romania, Bulgaria and the Visegrad Four, this is reflected in low active aging and child wellbeing index rankings, relatively small social investment in early human capital, weak improvements in prospective old age dependency ratios, and large-scale emigration. Slovenia and the Visegrad Four, but not the Baltics, also became „pensioners‘ welfare states“ with prematurely strong pro-elderly policy bias. In some cases, massive early exit worsened pension system sustainability while boosting pensioners‘ electoral power (political push before demographic pull). However, around the time when the demographic window started closing (2010-2015), the political salience of family policies, work-family reconciliation policies, and active aging policy increased, often spurred by the same Christian-conservative and/or nationalist-populist parties that caused illiberal democratic backsliding.

Many EU lawyers (or at least this EU lawyer) have been turned into adrenaline junkies, opening their newspapers in the morning both anticipating and dreading the next development. However, when stepping back from the day-to-day cut and thrust, the European responses to the crises may reveal something deeper about the integration project. Take the eurocrisis and the rule of law crisis. At first sight, they seem far apart. Yet there are some lessons to be drawn from a comparison between the two. First, in both cases the response of the political institutions was or has been somewhat ineffectual. We remember how in the critical weeks and months of the eurocrisis the European Council would regularly meet and come up with new initiatives that calmed the markets for a few days but ultimately achieved little. The overwhelming sense was of too little, too late. In the main, the national politicians looked after the national interests—not the common European interest. In the same manner, in the rule of law crisis the art.7 TEU process has brought political dialogue and hearings, but little in the way of actually solving the issues. “The nuclear option” metaphor certainly needs to be rethought, unless a nuclear war in reality just involves a lot of inconclusive and slightly uncomfortable meetings. The ineffectual responses of the political institutions stand in stark contrast to the strategic and effective action by the independent non-political EU institutions: the European Central Bank and the Court of Justice. For the eurocrisis, the decisive moment came when President Draghi promised to do whatever it takes to safeguard the euro and this statement was turned into the OMT programme.1 The resolve of the ECB convinced the markets where the European Council could not. For the rule of law crisis, it is the Court that has emerged as the key actor. It has acted strategically. In Juizes Portugueses,2 a case that had nothing to do with the actual rule of law crisis, it weaponised art.19 TEU, first spending many lengthy paragraphs on the rule of law and its relationship to art.19 TEU, before finally finishing with a few lines on the issue of the Portuguese judicial salaries at hand. This was important: the use of art.19 TEU allows the Court to circumvent the awkward limitation in art.51 CFR, which restricts the Charter’s applicability to situations where Member States are implementing EU law. The Court was then able to apply the provision to Poland in subsequent cases, in particular finding a violation of the independence of the Polish Supreme Court and therefore a breach of art.19 TEU.3 As with the Bank, the Court’s actions had an immediate impact. The judges who had been forced to retire from the Polish Supreme Court were able to return to work. The ruling party’s attempt to sideline a specific group of judges failed. The Bank and the Court have not acted alone, however. The effectiveness of their actions has depended on the support of others. In the case of the OMT programme of the Bank, it was the support of the Court that was particularly important. The challenge to the OMT that materialised in the Gauweiler case was foreseeable and inevitable.4 One of the fundamental limits of EMU is the prohibition of monetary financing that is found in art.123 TFEU, and many \nin particular in Germany were convinced that the OMT programme breached it. The Court’s support for the Bank is well known: the Court emphasised the margin of discretion given to the ECB as an expert EU institution and upheld the programme. In the context of the rule of law, it is the Commission’s support for the Court that has been critical. The Court depends on cases being brought to it, and the Commission has obliged. Equally importantly, the Commission’s power to initiate follow-on actions under art.260 TFEU gives teeth to the rulings of the Court. Non-compliance would be extremely costly in the literal sense: significant penalty payments can be imposed and subsequently deducted from the sums that the country receives from the EU budget. The problem with the powerful action of the independent institutions and the ineffective responses of the political institutions is that the former cannot truly solve the crises, they can only halt them. The OMT programme pressed the pause button, but it did not resolve the problems in the design of the euro that made it so vulnerable in the first place. In the same way, the Court’s ruling against Poland got the judges back to work. But when their normal retirement age comes, will their successors be truly independent, or will the ruling party be subtly able to influence the appointments or judicial behaviour to ensure a more compliant Supreme Court? We should not underestimate the value of gaining time. The political and democratic processes are given another opportunity to take action or to rethink the issues.5 The results are not always impressive. In the context of the eurocrisis, we still lack the sizeable euro area budget that President Draghi saw as critical for the common currency.6 Instead of an elephant, the EU political process produced a mouse that has been locked in a cage.7 However, we do now have a partial Banking Union, and there has even been movement on a European deposit guarantee scheme,8 a vital component that has been missing so far. In the context of the rule of law crisis, the Polish voters were afforded an opportunity to rethink, but did not take it at this juncture. However, some progress has been made as a part of the ongoing EU budget negotiations to create a link between the rule of law and the receipt of EU funds. The proposed link is far from a panacea—action can only be taken if generalised rule of law deficiencies threaten the EU’s financial interests—but if approved it might give the Commission some scope to tighten the financial screws should the backsliding continue.9 Ultimately in a democracy, non-democratic independent institutions cannot take the fundamental decisions on the shape of the economy or the polity, but they can help create and protect the space that the political processes need for making these decisions.", :year 2019, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "European Law Review", :pages "739-740", :volume ""}, :authors [{:authorId "117560263", :name "J.

Фокусът върху поведението на изпълнителната власт обаче може да ни накара да пренебрегнем по-голяма заплаха за източноевропейската демокрация. Ние твърдим, че първородния грях на източноевропейските демокрации, „превзетата държава“, се е влошил от възхода на теориите на конспирацията, чийто запас само расте с добавянето на дезинформация за CОVID. Източноевропейските избиратели се борят да разграничат „истинската“ политическа конспирация, която позволява на частни интереси да контролират държавата, и конспирациите без емпирична основа, като отричането на COVID, наличието на световно правителство или политическата коректност като тираничен заговор. В резултат, конспиративните теории дават възможност на превзелите държавата да разцепят реформаторската опозиция и да запазят хватката си, като същевременно твърдят, че управляват компетентно и в съответствие с европейските ценности.

This focus, however, may lead us to overlook a bigger threat to Eastern European democracy. We argue that Eastern European democracies' original sin of state capture has been exacerbated by the rise of conspiracy theories, whose stock has only increased with the addition of COVID misinformation. Eastern European voters struggle to differentiate between the `true' political conspiracy that enables private interests to control the state and conspiracies without empirical basis, such as COVID denialism, world government, or political correctness as a tyrannical plot. As a result, conspiracy theories enable the state capture camp to divide the reformist opposition and maintain their grip, while simultaneously claiming that they are governing competently and in line with European values. We use an original survey from Bulgaria and a GLOBSEC 2020 cross-national survey to explore this hypothesis. Finally, we draw some theoretical implications from the empirical evidence for assessing the nature of democratic backsliding in Eastern Europe.

Several problems intrude. The United States does not have a tradition of Christian Democratic parties. These parties, whose platforms were marked by a concern for personal dignity, subsidiarity, and a lively sense of human frailty, often suffused the political life of nations such as Holland, Germany, France, and Austria with principles congenial to those of the Church's social teaching. (1) By contrast, as Louis Hartz argued, the liberal tradition is the tradition in American political life, and this may lead to a certain myopia regarding alternative ways of approaching public policy questions. (2) Complicating the problem is the fact that it is not clear where either side stands in relation to the other. This is partly a result of a long history of mutual suspicion. The anti-Catholic tradition in American public life runs deeper than we like to think. (3) Even more important, however, is the long history of antagonism between the Church and proponents of modern democracy. While this history has been redressed somewhat by the Church's recent promotion of democratic regimes throughout the world, advocates of democracy may still think of the Church as a relatively recent friend who sometimes backslides. (4) Then again, citizens of liberal democracy--including many Catholics--are often suspicious of the Church's claim to authority on social issues. Why should any American think of this body of teaching as authoritative in the current marketplace of ideas? This attitude is partly a function of the separation of church and state, with its sense that the Church is a voluntary social organization among many others. Recent scandals do not help in this regard. For many, the Church appears to be just another interest group advocating yet one more political agenda. If so, there is no compelling reason to give its social teachings any more weight than we would give to a pundit's or lobbyist's proposals. Finally, part of the difficulty is that it is not clear where the Church stands in relation to liberal democracy. (5) Sometimes she praises, and other times criticizes, aspects of it. How can we expect our fellow citizens to take the Church's teachings about liberal democracy seriously when she seems muddled about what she thinks? Do we have to resolve this ambivalence before we start a conversation? One cannot explain this ambivalence away by arguing that the Church's social teaching has evolved, for we find that ambivalence persists in more recent encyclicals. (6) If the notion of an evolving social teaching will not do, can we resolve the ambivalence by seeking some underlying consistency in the Church's teachings about liberal democracy? Perhaps, but both these strategies assume that ambivalence should be avoided. Yet, isn't ambivalence a proper response to an ambiguous situation? What if Catholic social teaching's ambivalence toward western liberal democracies reflects ambiguities within them? If so, we should try to understand how modern democracies like the United States contain ambiguities that invite ambivalent judgments. In fact, perhaps this goes a long way toward answering our question about how to get Americans to take Catholic social thought seriously. Perhaps beginning a profitable conversation entails understanding better the ambiguities within American political practices and showing how Catholic social thought can move beyond them in a way our conventional practices cannot.

The health crisis was followed by democratic backsliding which directly impacted the fight for economic crime. The pre-pandemic political commitment to fight corruption is assessed with the pandemic environment and the policy decisions by the Government. Sri Lanka was a detailed case study of how politicians exploited the pandemic environment to suppress democracy and move their semi-autocratic agenda forward.

Critics have long argued that the EU suffers from a democratic deficit and that growing EU power undermines national democracy. The recent slide toward autocracy in Hungary and the EU’s efforts to stop it – remind us that, whatever the EU’s flaws, democratic deficits can also exist at the national level and the EU may have a crucial role to play in safeguarding democracy and the rule of law. This issue of Europe’s “other democratic deficit” is not confined to Hungary, as other EU member states have also experienced backsliding on democracy and the rule of law. This paper will place the EU’s struggles with democratic deficits in its member states in comparative perspective, drawing on the experience of other democracies – including Mexico, to Argentina, to the United States in the era of the “Solid South” – which have struggled with pockets of subnational authoritarianism. Comparative analysis suggests that legal levers alone are unlikely to safeguard democracy at the subnational (or in EU’s case, national) level: so long as political leaders are willing to put partisan interests above democratic values, they may allow local pockets of autocracy to persist for decades within otherwise democratic political systems.", :year 2016, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "", :volume ""}, :authors [{:authorId "2800923", :name "R.

In many countries, including EU members and their close neighbours, we can observe the so called democratic backsliding in the current decade. Political scientists have been discussing intensively the reasons behind this process. The proposed paper focuses on the rising phenomenon of majoritarianism which seems to contribute to the problems of democratic governance – particularly in the polarised and diverse societies in terms of the world outlook, beliefs and political sympathies because of the dominance of a particular political and social group or groups in a political system. The aim of the article is to analyse different paths of development of majoritarianism in the 1990s and the 2000s and its impact on the political regime in the current decade. The case of Turkey as one of the “hardest” cases to indicate the phenomenon is compared to some selected states from Central Europe to verify the main hypothesis that the structural factors emerging within the historical process are behind the development of majoritarianism, which has been even strengthened in the current decade, including the pandemic period in 2020. Methods and materials. The author takes the qualitative approach. He uses the process-tracing method to investigate the development of majoritarianism in selected states and conducts the comparative analysis to identify the similarities and differences between Turkey and two Central European states Hungary and Poland with reference to the analysed phenomenon. Results. At the turn of the 1990s and the 2000s a concentration of the party system, producing a decrease in the number of parties in the parliament and a rising party system polarization that strengthened the two largest parties and developed two ideological blocks resulted in the development of majoritarianism in the 2000s – mainly in Turkey and Hungary. It did not lead to the democracy decline at this time. In the second decade of the 21st century single-party governments (or coalition governments with one dominating party) sharing the majoritarian understanding of democracy have consolidated their power at the cost of the weakening of the opposition as well as have strengthened the executive – in relation to the legislature and judiciary. These processes have led to limitations in working of checks and balances system but also political and social pluralism due to increasing dominance of incumbents in political and social life of analyzed countries, particularly during the pandemic period. Discussion and conclusions. In Hungary and Poland the phenomenon of majoritarianism contributes so far to lowering the quality of democracy – in comparison with the Turkish situation reflecting rather the gradual change of the political regime to less democratic (i.e. a new type of authoritarianism).

This paper extends several such works, tracing the historical development of structural design choices in the U.S. Constitution, the underlying philosophical debates of the framers, and peak eras of partisan polarization, explaining historical trajectories and present-day worries through a comparative politics lens. In so doing, the paper advances several arguments. One, models of risks to American democracy are alarming, but require extension and careful comparison. Two, the constitutional framers created long-lasting institutions, but they could not foresee the kinds of national polarizing issues which might undermine -- and have already compromised -- democracy systemically. Three, combining the legal and political science research traditions on American constitutionalism provides a guide for much-needed research on grave questions of democratic resilience, especially given the modern extremity of partisan-ideological polarization. Four, the insights of comparative politics research on democratic consolidation, in particular the empirical research on \"fragile\" democracies, should be applied to the United States -- a country, it merits repeating, which only recently attained true \"democratic\" status in the wake of the 1960s. Finally, this paper integrates the various literatures to argue for a systematic series of proposals to curb deteriorating democratic norms and procedures in U.S. government. Risks to America's democratic constitutional system have been gravely understated, and even the sharpest evaluations have ignored how initial institutional design choices and modern comparative examples of democratic backsliding combine dangerously in 2019.

To date, international lawyers have been caught between the exceedingly careful approach, by either resisting to the notion of democracy as a legal concept tout court or acknowledging that only the electoral dimension of democracy, that is the right to free and fair elections, is a positive legal right, and the exceedingly maximalist approach, according to which democracy, equated with all sorts of social virtues of a liberal society, is a human right and a state obligation. Both accounts suffer from a lack of a clear methodological reflection and thus fail upon deeper theoretical scrutiny. This thesis sets out to respond to these shortcomings by developing a contextualised (context-aware) approach to democracy but within the proper confines of the de lege lata legal discourse. That said, global constitutionalism as a political theory and a legal approach providing the most adequate account of transformative nature and potential of international law serves as a theoretical framework for the present thesis. On this account, because (empirically validated) constitutionalisation of international law entails the law’s increasing autonomisation vis-à-vis states, non-consensual elements within international law, such as teleological and evolutive treaty interpretation, evolving nature of custom towards one accommodating interests of states as members of the international community, softening of international legal obligation, the ever-growing impact of equitable general principles and the reinvigorated role of legitimacy in the legal discourse, provide an important source of the democratic entitlement’s legal underpinnings. Beyond this complex theoretical construction, it is shown that not only is the right to democracy an abstract academic invention fostered by the constitutional rationale, but it is also actively defended both by the international community (external defence) and domestic actors (internal defence). Whereas the external mechanism of democracy promotion and defence is marked by the elevated willingness of the international community to intervene in response to democratic disruptions and backsliding, such as coups d’état, the internal mechanism is triggered by the bottom-up resistance by means of revolution as an ultima ratio tool to restore democracy and an ultimate remedy to effectuate the right to democratic governance. It is concluded that international law recognises the right to democratic governance and provides for the external and internal mechanisms of its defence and enforcement. Certainly, this does not signify an end to the contestation over the substantive scope of democracy and the concrete parameters of its legal status. However, this does suggest that the preceding black and white discussions on democracy are clearly insufficient for understanding the operation of this multifaceted concept and its impact on international relations.

That’s the principle finding from the latest edition of Freedom in the World, Freedom House’s annual survey of global political rights and civil liberties. The decline, which was reflected in reversals in one-fifth of the world’s countries, was most pronounced in South Asia, but also reached significant levels in the former Soviet Union, the Middle East and North Africa, and sub-Saharan Africa. It affected a substantial number of large and politically important countries—including Russia, Pakistan, Kenya, Egypt, Nigeria, and venezuela—whose declines have wider regional and global implications. Other countries experienced reversals after a period of progress toward democracy, including pivotal states in the Arab Middle East. Although the number of countries designated Free, Partly Free, or Not Free changed little during the past year, there were many overwhelmingly negative changes within these broad categories. Furthermore, results for 2007 marked the second consecutive year in which the survey registered a decline in freedom, representing the first twoyear setback in the past 15 years. In all, nearly four times as many countries showed significant declines during the year as registered improvements. Many countries that moved backward were already designated Not Free; in other cases, countries with recent records of improved democratic institutions were unable to sustain progress and gave clear signals of backsliding. Civil conflict was an important contributing factor to this year’s negative trajectory in South Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. The year also saw the intensification of an effort by authoritarian regimes to consolidate their power through the suppression of democratic opposition, civil society, and independent media—a process also known as the pushback against democracy. Freedom of association suffered a setback on a global scale, as governments in various regions initiated policies to weaken or neutralize nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), human rights monitoring groups, and trade unions. Especially important in carrying out this assault on civil society were a group of marketoriented autocracies and energy-rich dictatorships that combine elements of a capitalist economy with sophisticated techniques of political repression. A particularly worrying phenomenon that emerges from the findings is the negative impact of powerful autocracies on smaller, less powerful neighboring countries. Russia provides diplomatic and political support to a number of brutal dictatorships and autocratic regimes on its borders, including Belarus and states in Central Asia, and puts pressure on nearby governments, such as Estonia and Georgia, whose policies or leaders it disapproves of.

We offer a theoretical framework that highlights the limitations of strategies that ignore individuals’ directional motives. We propose three interventions that leverage insights on how social identity shapes behavior, and test each with an information experiment in Côte d’Ivoire, a polarized country. We find that a standard digital literacy intervention fails to curb the belief in and spread of misinformation, while our social-identity based interventions limited both.

Examples of the collapse of democracy have shown the lack of free and fair elections, which threatens the independence of the judiciary, the restriction of the right to freedom of speech, and the political opposition’s ability to challenge the government, prosecute and offer alternatives to the regime. The government poses a threat to national security in order to create a „sense of crisis” that allows the government to „denigrate critics as pro-government or unpatriotic” and portray defenders of democratic institutions as „representatives of a tired, isolated elite”. With this in mind, the purpose of the study was determined – to systematize the factors of the collapse of democracy. In order to achieve this goal, the criteria of approaches to the analysis of the problems of coagulation of democracy were analyzed and systematized. As a result, the factors of the collapse of democracy include: the weakening of political institutions, violations of individual rights and freedom of thought, which call into question the efficiency and stability of democratic systems. It is established that the problematic aspects are the level of inequality, differences in identity; democratization through bottom-up peaceful protests has led to a higher level of democracy and democratic stability than democratization caused by elites; constitutions resulting from pluralism (reflecting different segments of society) are more likely to promote liberal democracy (at least in the short term); that the threat of civil conflict encourages regimes to make democratic concessions; development in a democratic direction requires collective security; the process of democratization can occur by chance, as it depends on unique characteristics and circumstances; correlation of democratization with democratization of knowledge as the spread of the ability to create and legitimize knowledge among citizens, in contrast to knowledge under the control of elite groups; correlation with the effect of democratization of design.

We leverage a conjoint survey experiment in Hungary to probe competing mechanisms of citizen tolerance towards democratic violations in a context of severe backsliding. Our main contribution consists of demonstrating empirically the presence of a composite effect, whereby authoritarian-leaning elites succeed in offering targeted compensations to different groups, ultimately building a mosaic of support among voters to secure enduring electoral backing. We pinpoint trade-offs notably related to cultural conservatism and economic benefits among different subgroups of the population. At the same time, our empirical findings indicate surprisingly high levels of condemnation of undemocratic positions by Hungarian respondents. We discuss how this unexpected pattern points to the limitations of conjoint designs as well as the overlooked supply side of democratic backsliding.

An analysis based on the connection between populism and excessive charisma presents Hugo Chavez’s consolidation of power and subsequent democratic breakdown in Venezuela.

Ultimately, Hugo Chavez’s populist agenda deconstructed the Venezuelan democratic system and paved the path for the rise of authoritarianism. The conclusions in this paper regarding the destructive effects of populism on Venezuelan democracy can provide useful insights for political researchers and policymakers in contemporary liberal democracies.", :year 2023, :openAccessPdf {:url "https://drpress.org/ojs/index.php/EHSS/article/download/4275/4127", :status "HYBRID"}, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "Journal of Education, Humanities and Social Sciences"}, :authors [{:authorId "2143582", :name "Haowen Tan"}]} {:paperId "fdbb03c2ee510bee586f7e0a2f108fe4145ae66b", :title "Safeguarding Democracy and the Rule of Law by Civil Society Actors?

I study the long-run political consequences of authoritarianism in the context of India, the world's largest democracy. Utilizing the unexpected timing of the authoritarian rule imposed in the 1970s and the variation in a draconian policy, I document a sharp decline in the share of the then incumbent party's, the Indian National Congress, votes and the probability of its candidates winning in subsequent elections. The decline in the incumbent party's political dominance was not at the expense of a lower voter turnout rate. Instead, a sharp rise in the number of opposition candidates contesting for election in subsequent years played an important role. Finally, I examine the enduring consequences, revealing that confidence in politicians remains low in states where the draconian policy was high.", :year 2022, :openAccessPdf {:url "https://preprints.apsanet.org/engage/api-gateway/apsa/assets/orp/resource/item/6201e5774e899e79ec467c16/original/the-legacy-of-authoritarianism-in-a-democracy.pdf", :status "GREEN"}, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "SSRN Electronic Journal"}, :authors [{:authorId "118496251", :name "P.

Changes in parties and leaders since 1989 are discussed, as well as how citizens feel about certain democratic values. Particular attention is paid to freedoms such as speech, the press, and elections. Additionally, corruption and scandal in each country are explored along with some more recent government policies. Ultimately, it is determined that while both countries are democracies, there are indications that some democratic backsliding is taking place.

Early studies suggested that this resulted in exclusionary attitudes and increased support for discriminatory policy measures. We still lack an understanding of the longer‐term, potentially erosive consequences that COVID‐19‐specific anxieties may carry for citizens' commitment to liberal democratic norms. In this research note, we present evidence from an original experiment in which we manipulate individuals' cognitive accessibility of their fears related to COVID‐19. We implemented this experiment in Hungary and Romania – two cases where illiberal attitudes are most likely to amplify under conditions of fear – a year and a half after the outbreak of the pandemic. The results show that our intervention is successful in elevating respondents' levels of worry, anxiety and fear when thinking about infectious diseases like COVID‐19. However, these emotions do not carry secondary effects on individuals' levels of right‐wing authoritarianism, nationalism or outgroup hostility, nor do they affect preferences for specific discriminatory policy measures aimed to fight a potential resurgence of COVID‐19. We discuss these findings in light of the literature on the demand‐side determinants of democratic backsliding and the consequences of emotions on political behaviour.", :year 2021, :openAccessPdf {:url "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/1475-6765.12554", :status "HYBRID"}, :publicationTypes ["JournalArticle"], :journal {:name "European Journal of Political Research"}, :authors [{:authorId "113453857", :name "Veronica Anghel"} {:authorId "1404823623", :name "Julia Schulte-Cloos"}]} {:paperId "fe4bbed7ab4c3bfb8759686ccd3ce5bab53d1619", :title "Grassroots authoritarianism: WhatsApp, middle-class boundary-making and pandemic governance in New Delhi’s neighbourhoods", :abstract "ABSTRACT Against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, this paper documents how ordinary digital technologies, such as WhatsApp, were (re)appropriated for communication and pandemic coordination at a time when face-to-face meetings were impossible. However, there was also an emergent ‘dark’ side to its use. In the context of India’s democratic backsliding, middle-class Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs) deployed everyday technologies to (re)configure exclusionary digital socio-spatial boundaries through practices of ‘grassroots authoritarianism’. The paper documents how the national government co-opted RWAs in the implementation of COVID-19 rules and examines their role as an extension of the state within a longer history of middle-class power in India’s cities. We evidence how the ‘WhatsApp panopticon’ was mobilized as a tool of everyday community care and surveillance to shape morality regimes and influence the compliance of residents with national and locally enforced rules. We argue that digital socio-spatial practices of securitization, fear and compliance represent forms of ‘grassroots authoritarianism’ that echo and ensconce state-led ideological change in India. Building on ‘everyday authoritarianism’ we show how digital technologies and middle-class organizations are mediating India’s authoritarian shift from below.", :year 2023, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "Territory, Politics, Governance", :pages "1121 - 1140", :volume "11"}, :authors [{:authorId "118021940", :name "Lipika Kamra"} {:authorId "48018328", :name "Philippa Williams"} {:authorId "122779387", :name "P.

Under the emergency rule, constitutional rights and liberties are suspended and parliament and the courts are reduced to the regime's rubber stamp, while the country is ruled by one man through decrees. While many question how the legal and political developments in Turkey will unfold, and whether and how the democratic backslide and decline in rule of law can be reversed, Indira Gandhi's emergency (1975–77) offers a useful historical heuristic case. With striking similarities to the conditions in Turkey today, during the Indian emergency the judiciary, especially the Indian Supreme Court (ISC), was subjugated to the will of Prime Minister Gandhi through means of constitutional amendments and political appointments that compromised the integrity of justices. Yet, shortly after the end of emergency the ISC regained the trust and respect of the Indian people, thereby playing an instrumental role in the restoration of Indian democracy. Through a close analysis of the Indian emergency rule, the present article explores the conditions of democratic survival and whether and how the Turkish judiciary can reclaim its independence, spearhead a rights revolution, and help restore the democratic order.", :year 2018, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "Review of Middle East Studies", :pages "54 - 65", :volume "52"}, :authors [{:authorId "117890840", :name "Y.

They are therefore exposed to a heightened risk of backlash that questions their authority and impedes the implementation of their judgments. This article puts forward an analytical framework for mapping the resilience techniques used by international courts to counter this growing resistance. Case studies involve the Court of Justice of the European Union, which has been cautious in its stance regarding democratic backsliding in Hungary and Poland, and the Caribbean Court of Justice, which has engaged in legal diplomacy while adjudicating both on the land rights of indigenous groups and on Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Queer and Intersex (LGBTQI) rights. It is argued that, in order to effectively avoid and mitigate backlash, international courts should deploy resilience techniques that go beyond merely exercising their judicial function. The successful deployment of resilience techniques can allow international courts to become significant actors in global governance during a time of crisis for the international liberal order.", :year 2021, :openAccessPdf nil, :publicationTypes nil, :journal {:name "International and Comparative Law Quarterly", :pages "737 - 768", :volume "70"}, :authors [{:authorId "115448339", :name "Salvatore Caserta"} {:authorId "116545030", :name "Pola Cebulak"}]})
